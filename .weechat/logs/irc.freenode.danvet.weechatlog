2016-08-04 10:11:12	diegoyam	Hi, just think I got a regression of https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=68485
2016-08-04 10:11:29	diegoyam	not sure it's a regression or a similar one
2016-08-04 10:11:39	diegoyam	where should I report it?
2016-08-04 10:12:01	diegoyam	file a new bug? or send my dmesg to this already existing one?
2016-08-04 10:13:55	danvet	file new bug, or let's chat on #intel-gfx
2016-08-04 10:14:02	danvet	private discussions with maintainers don't scale
2016-08-04 10:14:55	diegoyam	ok, sorry
2016-08-04 10:15:14	diegoyam	didn't know the proper channel to discuss this
2016-08-04 10:15:16	diegoyam	thanks
