2016-09-14 14:11:24	alexey	hi
2016-09-14 14:11:26	Serus	do we build the cdb plugin for qt creator?
2016-09-14 14:11:45	Serus	in my build I got an error that the cdb plugin couldn't be found
2016-09-14 14:12:28	nickoe	Serus: can't you see that in the pkgbuild?
2016-09-14 14:13:44	Serus	doesn't look like it
2016-09-14 14:14:12	mati865	mixing cdb with mingw stuff sounds like a bad idea
2016-09-14 14:14:26	Serus	I'm not mixing with mingw stuff
2016-09-14 14:14:31	Serus	I downloaded the msvc build tools
2016-09-14 14:14:40	Serus	but starting the debugger will give that error
2016-09-14 14:21:30	mati865	it detected cdb from windows kits but I cannot test it since I don't have msvc build
2016-09-14 14:21:50	mati865	so it should work
2016-09-14 14:21:57	Serus	it doesn't :(
2016-09-14 14:22:31	mati865	what about Qt Creator provided with Qt?
2016-09-14 14:22:42	Serus	Internal error: The extension C:\msys64\mingw64\lib\qtcreatorcdbext64\qtcreatorcdbext.dll cannot be found.
2016-09-14 14:22:58	Serus	that one works, but I don't like installing the IDE multiple times
2016-09-14 14:33:41	nickoe	What exactly is cdb?
2016-09-14 14:39:59	Serus	the windows debugger that allows you to debug msvc compiled applications

2016-09-15 12:51:49	maximilian	Hello, I have a problem with perl input from STDIN. If you ask for user input the script doesn't print the output before the input, but waits for the input
2016-09-15 12:51:55	maximilian	here a simple example:
2016-09-15 12:52:14	maximilian	print "What is your name?\n";
2016-09-15 12:52:18	maximilian	my $name = <STDIN>;
2016-09-15 12:52:29	maximilian	print "\nHello $name\n";
2016-09-15 12:52:39	maximilian	the output should be:
2016-09-15 12:52:44	maximilian	What is your name
2016-09-15 12:52:52	maximilian	<wait for input>
2016-09-15 12:52:56	maximilian	Hello name
2016-09-15 12:53:20	maximilian	But instead of this. The shell doesn't output anythin until you press enter
2016-09-15 12:53:46	maximilian	this bug only affects the mingw64 shell; the msys2 and mingw32 shell work just fine!!!
2016-09-15 12:53:54	maximilian	Can anybode help?
2016-09-15 12:55:09	jasom	maximilian: stdout ought to be line buffered, so the newline should flush it.
2016-09-15 12:56:22	maximilian	yes I thought this, too. But the "\n" after What is your name didn't help
2016-09-15 12:59:40	mati865	it's mintty bug I think
2016-09-15 12:59:54	mati865	had it with C programs also
2016-09-15 13:00:25	mati865	you can try launching commands with "winpty <commands>"
2016-09-15 13:00:39	maximilian	Did you know some workaround? Where can I post a bug report?
2016-09-15 13:00:51	maximilian	thanks for the idea
2016-09-15 13:01:19	maximilian	I has to run the command in mingw64 shell, nor?
2016-09-15 13:01:33	mati865	yes
2016-09-15 13:02:52	mati865	alexey: are you there?
2016-09-15 13:03:49	maximilian	I get the error: winpty command not found
2016-09-15 13:05:12	maximilian	the only package I found at https://sourceforge.net/p/msys2/wiki/Packages/ is for msys (winpty-git) Is this the right package?

2016-09-15 14:29:40	hcorion	Hi all! So, I'm a little confused. There are a ton of packages for MINGW-w64 but not for msys2. I was under the impression that msys2 was the superior platform to build packages under (vs the mingw64 executable) but while trying to compile a package under msys2, cmake had no option for MSYS Makefiles? only UNIX MAKEFILES. I'm very confused right now. Can someone clarify this?
2016-09-15 14:35:34	nickoe	hcorion: what is your goal?  the mingw packages are "native" binaries for windows
2016-09-15 14:35:59	hcorion	Ok, so then what are msys2 packages?
2016-09-15 14:37:57	hcorion	I just know that most  tutorials I see of compiling open source projects were under MINGW, I assumed they didn't use msys2 because either msys2 didn't have the correct dependencies or because msys2 was so new that they hadn't gotten to compiling it.
2016-09-15 14:39:27	hcorion	But I was under the impression that it would benefit these packages to at some point switch to msys2 in the future, because it was better than MINGW. Is this not the case?
2016-09-15 14:39:40	hcorion	Or at least add support for msys2
2016-09-15 14:40:55	hcorion	Also, when I refer to MINGW, I mean the MINGW64 executable that msys2 uses. Not the older project
2016-09-15 14:46:48	mati865	MSYS2 packages are build for emulated Unix and packages should behave like on the Unix, MSYS Makefiles mean that you want native win32 build but done inside POSIX env
2016-09-15 14:48:29	nickoe	When you run stuff under the msys2 shell you are using this emulated unix envronment, hence the UNIX makefiles optin.    Under the mingw shells you use the MSYS makefiles because you are building with a mingw toolchain. Or something.
2016-09-15 14:48:47	mati865	msys2 packages are just like Cygwin, it offers better compatibility with Linux but at cost of the performance
2016-09-15 14:49:52	mati865	that's why most of the stuff use MinGW-w64, it's native Windows build but lacking POSIX features
2016-09-15 14:53:30	hcorion	Alright, I understand now, thanks for clarifying that.

2016-09-16 10:46:27	lh_mouse	Intel Transactional Memory. IIRC.
2016-09-16 10:46:49	lh_mouse	mati865, https://github.com/Alexpux/MINGW-packages/blob/master/mingw-w64-gcc-git/0012-MinGW-w64-Enable-libitm.patch
2016-09-16 10:46:50	m2bot	Title: MINGW-packages/0012-MinGW-w64-Enable-libitm.patch at master · Alexpux/MINGW-packages · GitHub (at github.com)
2016-09-16 10:47:21	mati865	ah, so disabling weak refs was rather inproper workaround than real fix?
2016-09-16 10:47:54	lh_mouse	I am not sure, because I am not suffering from the problem.
2016-09-16 10:48:37	mati865	ok I'll keep it disabled and see if I encouter any problems
2016-09-16 10:48:46	mati865	Thank you lh_mouse!
2016-09-16 10:49:00	lh_mouse	That patch by LRN allows configuration of libitm. On gcc-5-branch it produces a DLL that exports nothing, and on gcc-6-branch it produces no DLL.
2016-09-16 10:50:22	lh_mouse	I did ask LRN quite a few days ago about it, and he said that patch only guaranteed that libitm could _build_. However the library turned out to never work.
2016-09-16 10:50:55	lh_mouse	Personally, I have been excluding that patch since then.
2016-09-16 10:51:10	mati865	so it shouldn't be even enabled
2016-09-16 10:51:21	mati865	*this patch*
2016-09-16 10:51:30	lh_mouse	Sort of.
2016-09-16 10:51:41	 *	lh_mouse goes search his IRC log.
2016-09-16 10:54:19	lh_mouse	wtf I reinstalled my system at the beginning of this August and all logs before that were gone!
2016-09-16 10:55:30	mati865	Windows apps store their data at system partition
2016-09-16 10:55:37	mati865	yeah it's stupid
2016-09-16 10:56:21	lh_mouse	I wish I could change my home directory to a non-system partition.
2016-09-16 10:56:37	mati865	you can create junction
2016-09-16 10:56:49	mati865	but it's not really safe

2016-09-16 10:58:42	mati865	I think there is no need for it, You explained me even more than I came here for
2016-09-16 10:58:54	mati865	thank you for your time

2016-09-23 12:30:36	mati865	alexey: new binutils seems to be stable, however they didn't solve issue with ITM symbols in static libstdc++. I'll return patch disabling weak refs, so you can recompile it when you return.

2016-09-23 12:31:15	mati865	ok
2016-09-23 12:31:19	lh_mouse	mati865, so it was binutils that was the issue maker?
2016-09-23 12:31:36	mati865	"however they didn't solve issue"
2016-09-23 12:31:54	mati865	lh_mouse: meow?
2016-09-23 12:31:59	lh_mouse	0.0
2016-09-23 12:34:32	lh_mouse	`selectany` and `weak` aren't equivalent. `selectany` behaves like `inline` on functions in C++ (but not in C).
2016-09-23 12:35:11	mati865	unless somebody find better fix weak refs will be disabled in libstdc++
2016-09-23 12:35:26	lh_mouse	on the contrary, `weak` is applied to the `operator new` provided by libstdc++ itself. The weak one gets used only if a user-defined (strong) one is not provided.
2016-09-23 12:36:55	lh_mouse	I don't put opinion on it. Weak symbols in .a libraries used to work perfectly I think.
2016-09-23 12:37:50	mati865	I think they don't work properly right now
2016-09-23 12:38:40	lh_mouse	That is my thought. I don't think so.
2016-09-23 12:40:33	mati865	everything under `#if _GLIBCXX_USE_WEAK_REF` was added in GCC 6
2016-09-23 12:40:55	mati865	maybe they didn't work properly from the beginning but we didn't see it

2016-09-23 13:26:16	lh_mouse	mati865, try compiling the following C++ program using a toolchain with weak refs disabled:   #include <cstddef> #include <cstdlib> void *operator new(std::size_t n){ return std::malloc(n); } void operator delete(void *p) noexcept { std::free(p); } int main(){ delete new int; }
2016-09-23 13:26:42	lh_mouse	I am afraid you could get multiple definitions.

2016-09-23 13:28:47	lh_mouse	The global allocation and deallocation functions provided by libstdc++ (rather, libsupc++) are examples of weak functions.

2016-09-24 11:21:13	lh_mouse	@~
2016-09-24 11:21:18	lh_mouse	GIT CRAP.
2016-09-24 11:21:30	Genju	GIT GUD!
2016-09-24 11:21:51	mati865	using `~` wotj polish layout is fucking complicated
2016-09-24 11:21:56	mati865	with*
2016-09-24 11:23:10	lh_mouse	how does polish layout look like? :>
2016-09-24 11:23:42	lh_mouse	wait a moment.
2016-09-24 11:24:01	mati865	well, the only difference is that we use right alt + letter to create special letters
2016-09-24 11:24:08	lh_mouse	I forgot to regenerate its checksum.

2016-09-24 11:24:13	mati865	like ą,ę,ć,ó,ś
2016-09-24 11:25:33	mati865	and someone in M$ though it would be great to make possible creating those characters with `~` + letter
2016-09-24 11:27:31	mati865	so to type `~` character you have to press it twice (it will create `~~` and then erase one with Backscape), or press `~` and space
2016-09-24 11:28:15	mati865	hope alexey can commit it soon
2016-09-24 11:28:51	mati865	it's working normally in Unix like systems
2016-09-24 11:29:07	mati865	only in Windows it's fucking retarded
2016-09-24 11:31:05	lh_mouse	I use Shift + ` (the key on the left of number 1).
2016-09-24 11:31:32	mati865	it's normal layout
2016-09-24 11:32:27	lh_mouse	Force-pushed. 
2016-09-24 11:34:19	mati865	maybe I wasn't clear enough,  to type `~` character you have to press Shift + "`" twice (it will create `~~` and then erase one with Backscape), or press Shift + "`" and space
2016-09-24 11:35:22	lh_mouse	O.O
2016-09-24 11:35:52	lh_mouse	Why do keyboards have to be so complex...
2016-09-24 11:36:10	lh_mouse	building gcc-git now.
2016-09-24 11:38:27	mati865	it's easy in Unix/Linux etc
2016-09-24 11:38:50	mati865	but M$ always have to complicate it
