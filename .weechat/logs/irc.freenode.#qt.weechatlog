Are you able to connect to the rfcomm device with other methods and write to it? Are you seeing the expected end results for the first few messages?

2016-07-27 18:33:36	endrift	this makes that function crash if you can't pull the GL1.1 functions out of the context while trying to do QPixmap drawing on a QGLContext-backed painter
2016-07-27 18:33:47	endrift	which is a problem two of my users have reported.
2016-07-27 18:35:34	endrift	https://github.com/mgba-emu/mgba/issues/302 has the backtrace. First 4 frames are relevant.
2016-07-27 18:35:59	endrift	I can try to make a repro later, but it should be pretty trivial to reproduce.

2016-07-27 18:38:40	@peppe	endrift: sorry, are you asking why going through a function resolver for a GL1.1 function, or how come it's failing, or... ?
2016-07-27 18:39:11	endrift	why it's going through the function resolver for a GL1.1 function.
2016-07-27 18:39:34	endrift	The fact that it's failing, which makes sense depending on the GL format, is causing a crash
2016-07-27 18:41:16	endrift	I've not been able to reproduce it locally in my builds of my project; I think the format has something funky about it on newer Intel GPUs in Mesa, but I haven't verified this myself.
2016-07-27 18:41:37	endrift	But it should trivially be reproducible if you change the profile manually
2016-07-27 18:43:09	endrift	as a result of this, I don't know how to work around it. I'm just drawing a pixmap.
2016-07-27 18:43:27	@peppe	the underlying reason is because on Windows Qt doesn't link to opengl32.dll
2016-07-27 18:43:32	@peppe	at runtime it makes the decision of using opengl32.dll or ANGLE
2016-07-27 18:43:55	@peppe	so all GL functions, even the GL1 ones, go through a function resolver
2016-07-27 18:44:41	endrift	Right I mean I know why the resolver is there in the first place
2016-07-27 18:45:01	endrift	but why is it specifically using the qgl1 resolver, which can fail depending on the format used?
2016-07-27 18:45:26	endrift	it should work fine with whichever qgl resolver it tries to use
2016-07-27 18:45:45	endrift	unless I'm misunderstanding how the resolvers work, but the source looks pretty straightforward
2016-07-27 18:46:17	AmR|EiSa	I will go have good day all.
2016-07-27 18:46:21	@peppe	because that's a GL1 function

2016-07-27 18:46:46	@peppe	that's => glGetTexLevelParameteriv
2016-07-27 18:46:53	@peppe	notably, GL ES2 lacks it
2016-07-27 18:47:17	@peppe	and the QOpenGLFunctions above, which models the "common subset" between GL2+FBO and ES2, lacks it too for this reason
2016-07-27 18:47:20	endrift	rrrright but the qgl1 resolver looks like it will just crash if it tries to do it on the wrong format
2016-07-27 18:47:25	@peppe	(great job, khronos, with ES2)
2016-07-27 18:47:47	endrift	the whole block is in an ifdef anyway
2016-07-27 18:48:10	endrift	actually why is that block needed in the first place? It seems to get the texture size, then tries to figure out if that texture size is valid?
2016-07-27 18:48:21	endrift	I guess in case it's lying or something...?
2016-07-27 18:48:36	endrift	in GLES, it just doesn't do that guesswork
2016-07-27 18:49:26	@peppe	wait, one thing is why there are all of those ifdefs, checks and function resolvers

2016-07-27 18:51:24	@peppe	or you may compile Qt with the full GL+GLES headers, but then you must check at runtime what you're actually running on (native GL? native GLES? GLES via ANGLE? GLES via GLX_EXT_create_context_es2_profile?)
2016-07-27 18:51:38	endrift	I'm not sure why you're telling me this
2016-07-27 18:51:45	@peppe	that guesswork is actually the right way of checking if your implemention supports a certain texture size
2016-07-27 18:51:46	endrift	I understand what the resolvers are for.
2016-07-27 18:51:56	endrift	oh
2016-07-27 18:51:58	@peppe	you must use a proxy texture and ask "can I allocate a texture this big?"
2016-07-27 18:52:15	endrift	then the thing that you get earlier in the function is just a theoretical maximum?
2016-07-27 18:52:25	@peppe	asking for GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE alone is pretty useless as the implementation does not guarantee you can allocate one that big (*sigh*)

2016-07-27 18:52:36	endrift	thanks Khronos
2016-07-27 18:52:38	@peppe	something like that, check the wording in the spec
2016-07-27 18:52:43	endrift	gotcha
2016-07-27 18:53:13	@peppe	of course the actual allocation can still fail due to out of memory, but NOT because you can't allocate something that big or using those formats
2016-07-27 18:53:14	endrift	regardless, you can fail to obtain a qgl1 resolver, and then qgl1_functions crashes when it tries to deref it

2016-07-27 19:09:36	Laurenceb__	annoyingly I wrote full gui last year
2016-07-27 19:09:46	Laurenceb__	with no hardware as it was still in production
2016-07-27 19:09:56	thiago	the 1-second delay is probably a bug in your code, which will probably remain in the GUI-less testcase
2016-07-27 19:09:58	Laurenceb__	so minimal test case would have to be written :(
2016-07-27 19:10:15	Laurenceb__	well no as I can see the regular write operations to the port
2016-07-27 19:10:20	Laurenceb__	with ~2ms rms jitter
2016-07-27 19:10:28	Laurenceb__	500 times lower than the jitter i see

2016-07-29 05:57:10	Franciman	Apps should be self-contained in their bundles, and may not read or write data outside the designated container area, nor may they download, install, or execute code, including other iOS, watchOS, Mac OS X, or tvOS apps.
2016-07-29 05:57:22	Franciman	so wouldn't adding the Qt framework to the bundle do the job?

2016-07-29 12:42:26	altendky	Gnjurac: the qt download page actually walks you through the questions (maybe 5?) and leads you to the license you can use
2016-07-29 12:42:42	altendky	Gnjurac: very roughly speaking, i would say yes

2016-08-19 19:22:16	TechEnthusiast	ok
2016-08-19 19:22:19	thiago	the load time of a static library versus dynamic is an entirely OS issue
2016-08-19 19:22:24	TechEnthusiast	ok
2016-08-19 19:22:34	thiago	your memory manager isn't involved. Your memory manager is being loaded.
2016-08-19 19:22:54	thiago	maybe your memory manager does have performance improvements. But that's orthogonal to the static-vs-dynamic choice.
2016-08-19 19:23:05	TechEnthusiast	ok
2016-08-19 19:23:15	richmoore	also benchmarking something like that well is a very hard problem

2016-08-19 19:23:33	richmoore	a microbenchmark will often give misleading results
2016-08-19 19:23:40	thiago	smaller binaries are important if you are loading from slow Flash
2016-08-19 19:23:48	thiago	if the storage is fast enough, you won't notice the difference
2016-08-19 19:24:08	thiago	if the libraries are dynamic and are already loaded because other applications are using it, then dynamic is much faster

2016-09-14 12:30:46	altendky	i would like to filter designer's widget box.  my attempt starts at line 80 http://pastebin.com/eJia8Mvf  basically, i save the widget box, load and modify the xml, save to another file, read and print so i can confirm elements were stripped, then reload into the widget box.  i see no change in the widget box.  ideas?
2016-09-14 12:31:05	TobiasFar	altendky, right..read that page trying to influence the behavior with no success so far..i mean instead of rendering it at a low resolution and scaling it up (what it looks like its doing now), why doesn't it just render it at a higher resolution.

2016-09-14 12:32:51	altendky	TobiasFar: at some point i'll have to learn those details but i don't know right now.  i think that ui's are often poorly developed with a mixture of pixel sized items and point sized items that would end up looking terrible if one set were scaled and not the other
2016-09-14 12:33:26	altendky	TobiasFar: so it may just be a lesser-evil sort of default (definitely some conjecture here)

2016-09-14 15:02:15	Tazmain	hi all, is there a turotial to create a GUI without using the designer ?
2016-09-14 15:04:39	altendky	Tazmain: i use pyqt and load the .ui files directly but i think that a regular c++ qt application builds the .ui files to code.  that generated code could be a good reference.

2016-09-14 15:07:26	niks_	hello everyone, i have a WId value inside a QString( so "0x02000004" for example), and I'd like to use it in a QWindow::fromWinId(WId id) function, but I don't find any function to cast it into the right type ... I actually don't find any documentation on the WId type ....
2016-09-14 15:08:00	Tazmain	do you create the ui using qml or by adding it via code ?

2016-09-14 15:08:29	niks_	via code
2016-09-14 15:08:39	altendky	Tazmain: i meant in designer.  i know you want to not use designer but it can generate reference code for you.
2016-09-14 15:08:39	\9	Tazmain: you create the widgets and set the layout up manually
2016-09-14 15:08:57	\9	http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/layout.html here is some neat explanation of all the layouts and some examples
2016-09-14 15:10:43	altendky	niks_: i'm guessing it is os specific as the docs say "handle id to a native window".  so look at window handles for your os.  how did you get the window handle?  might offer some clues as to what data type should be used.
2016-09-14 15:11:44	niks_	i use a shell script to get the windowId i need and pipe them into a QString(or char* or string or whatever I want),
2016-09-14 15:12:54	altendky	niks_: the program you parse it from probably says.  in the end, it's probably a 32-bit int from the looks of it.  i would guess unsigned.  the qt docs also seem to suggest you shouldn't do much with the returned qwindow

2016-09-14 18:28:37	MarkX	i'm super confused about window sizes. here is my current set up: Qwizard > qwizardpage > qvboxlayout > qtabwidget > qtreewidget > qtreewidgetitems
2016-09-14 18:28:37	MarkX	what i would like to do is resize my qwizardpage to the contents of my qtreewidgetitems.
2016-09-14 18:28:37	MarkX	my qtabwidget has horizontal scroll bars that i would like to get rid of. let me imgur it so you get an idea what i mean: http://i.imgur.com/bWoz60A.png
2016-09-14 18:28:37	MarkX	i would like to resize my window so i don't have that horizontal scrollbar anymore. i've been looking into .resize() but don't know what sizeHint or what object i should be applying it to
2016-09-14 18:29:42	FBeans	eugh can anyone help me with qt... nothing can find my qt4. it exists fine in /usr/lib64/qt4 Ive had to add export  LD_LIBRARY_PATH to get it to work correctly for some programs but now vlc fails as its not found. also when I run qtchooser -l it nly shows qt4 ?! :(
2016-09-14 18:29:51	thiago	scummos: there's no such thing as dynamically-sized stack arrays in C++11
2016-09-14 18:30:07	thiago	FBeans: first of all, upgrade
2016-09-14 18:30:24	thiago	FBeans: second, what is "nothing" that can't find Qt? How is it looking for Qt? How do you know it couldn't find?
2016-09-14 18:30:24	FBeans	I have qt5, but some programs seem to have a dep of qt4

2016-09-14 18:30:58	FBeans	thiago: previously running mumble (compiled using gentoo) said that it couldnt find qt4/ also running qtchooser doesnt show my qt4 libs
2016-09-14 18:31:06	scummos	thiago: huh.
2016-09-14 18:31:11	 *	scummos looks
2016-09-14 18:31:11	thiago	scummos: unless you mean dynamically allocated (with malloc or new)
2016-09-14 18:31:32	thiago	FBeans: I don't know what mumble is
2016-09-14 18:31:36	thiago	FBeans: how did ou install Qt 4?
2016-09-14 18:31:43	FBeans	well it's simply a program that uses qt4
2016-09-14 18:31:55	FBeans	I compile it using portage, gentoo's package manager
2016-09-14 18:32:13	thiago	ok
2016-09-14 18:32:20	thiago	did you create the file for qtchooser?
2016-09-14 18:32:24	FBeans	(btw when I add the env var of LD_LIBRARY_PATH It runs just fine)
2016-09-14 18:32:30	thiago	and by "you", I extend it to the tooling that you used to install Qt
2016-09-14 18:32:45	scummos	thiago: https://paste.kde.org/pg7d7cruc
2016-09-14 18:32:57	FBeans	thiago: when you say file, do you mean a config or the binary itself?
2016-09-14 18:33:20	thiago	FBeans: I mean a file
2016-09-14 18:33:31	thiago	FBeans: in either /etc/xdg/qtchooser or in ~/.config/qtchooser

2016-09-14 18:34:40	scummos	I thought it was in 14
2016-09-14 18:34:46	thiago	scummos: it was, then it wasn't
2016-09-14 18:34:53	scummos	yeah, I guess that's what confused me ;)

2016-09-14 18:34:56	thiago	it got yanked out of the standard
2016-09-14 18:34:56	scummos	do you know wh?
2016-09-14 18:34:59	scummos	*why
2016-09-14 18:35:04	thiago	because the C99 feature is nonsense
2016-09-14 18:35:17	Mike11	hello all :)
2016-09-14 18:35:26	thiago	even the C committee knows it and knows that it's impossible to implement everything they wrote
2016-09-14 18:35:34	scummos	haha ok
2016-09-14 18:35:42	thiago	sizeof on such an array is supposed to remember the size. Moreover, it's supposed to pass the size to functions it calls.
2016-09-14 18:35:48	Mike11	sorry my internet connection went down, I'll repeat my question again
2016-09-14 18:35:54	Mike11	 is it ok to override non-virtual functions in a Qt class?
2016-09-14 18:35:55	thiago	the C++ standard was trying to scale it back to a useful subset
2016-09-14 18:36:00	thiago	Mike11: sure
2016-09-14 18:36:00	Mike11	I will be using pointers to my derived type only
2016-09-14 18:36:16	Mike11	is that considered bad design?
2016-09-14 18:36:16	thiago	FBeans: then you didn't create the file. qtchooser won't find that Qt.
2016-09-14 18:36:24	Mike11	if someone else will be reading the code
2016-09-14 18:36:24	thiago	FBeans: you can create such a file yourself
2016-09-14 18:36:42	Mike11	thanks thiago :)
2016-09-14 18:36:51	FBeans	thiago: I could but i guess im more concerened why my package manager hasnt done that
2016-09-14 18:37:03	thiago	FBeans: I couldn't tell you
2016-09-14 18:37:19	FBeans	indeed I guess this is a job for #gentoo for now then

2016-09-15 08:45:40	altendky	simulacr: flags() is part of the model so you can get the selection manager (right name?) and figure out what is selected and from that you only set droppable if the index parameter to flags() is the same as the selection's parent (possiblye or invalid)
2016-09-15 08:46:00	altendky	simulacr: my best guess so far since i don't immediately see any way to know what is being dragged
2016-09-15 08:46:27	altendky	simulacr: though, that brings up an extra issue if you allow multiple selection you would have to restrict it to only be within a single parent

2016-09-15 09:24:07	Drzacek	I have some huge ass application, that was made for dos, but not for normal dos flavor, only some hacked version with real-time capability and some handicapped winapi. Now I want this to run on linux, and I chose Qt to be the applications GUI

2016-09-15 09:25:05	Drzacek	Since it would be extremely hard to write it from scratch, I thought to make a library project with Qt, and link it to my application (with some small changes)

2016-09-15 09:27:45	Drzacek	I can't run the gui in the same thread as my old main() function, because of the other event loop I have there, and I heard Qt GUI have to run in programs main thread, so I made it like this: my qt lib contains two classes (only one visible from outside, the other used internally). I create instance of that class in new main() function, constructor of that class creates instance of the second class and start new thread,
2016-09-15 09:27:45	Drzacek	that will run "old" main function

2016-09-15 09:44:23	Drzacek	Most of the functions are void, so they could be as they were. Most of those, that return something are type bool, so the program can detect success/failure - again, I could assume everything will run perfectly and when it fails, then whole program fails

2016-09-15 09:54:56	altendky	Drzacek: does the gui need to be realtime?  if not, the realtime code likely ought to be isolated and not be 'interactive' with the gui.  the realtime code should get data sent to it (and failsafe if not done on time) and then notify the nonRT code of it's status.

2016-09-15 23:59:12	thiago	the problem is after disconnectFromHost
2016-09-15 23:59:49	MDTech-us_MAN	maybe I should try putting `waitForBytesWritten()` after the flush?

2016-09-16 00:04:33	thiago	start with a threadpool of 1
2016-09-16 00:04:33	MDTech-us_MAN	after I get it going this far

2016-09-16 04:44:51	xarxer	Anyhoo. I'm writing an object oriented library wrappinga REST API. With this API I can fetch a Movie object (title, runtime, genres etc.). However, I can fetch other data about the movie via other API calls, for example getting the Credits for a movie is a separate API call.
2016-09-16 04:45:16	xarxer	I realize there's no go-to way to do this in a Qt-esque way.
2016-09-16 04:45:33	xarxer	But for example I don't want a Movie object to have an instance of a RestClient (seems wrong somehow)
2016-09-16 04:45:52	xarxer	However that would simplify things. (this->fetchCredits(); // or whatever)

2016-09-16 08:37:25	ahayzen	Hi, I was wondering if there is a way to detect the difference of the user closing a single window vs the user selecting quit (closing all windows). I need to know the difference so that I can save the state of the open windows, the AboutToQuit signal comes too late (after the windows have closed), the onClosing signal from the window happens to all the windows in both cases so doesn't help. Does anyone have any suggestions ?

2016-09-16 11:24:48	vicente	I'm reimplementing resizeEvent in my dialog but I'm getting random behaviours with areas not completetly redrawn when I resize the window. I think it's because I'm not forwarding the resize event itself to the parent class. But I'm not sure how to do that. Ideas?

2016-09-20 02:15:09	Drzacek	Hello
2016-09-20 02:16:36	Drzacek	Is there a way we can edit Qt main event loop? I want to port my program to Qt, but it already has it's own event loop. Earlier I thought to create separate thread for my main() function, but that brings some problems with GUI and signals - maybe I could combine my event loop with Qt so it would run in one thread?

2016-09-22 16:42:38	mathstuf	xcode 8?

2016-09-22 16:43:09	stefandxm	Version 8.0 (8A218a)
2016-09-22 16:43:47	stefandxm	is there no way to run qmake without xcodebuild?

2016-09-22 16:45:20	thiago	stefandxm: which Qt version?
2016-09-22 16:45:29	stefandxm	5.7
2016-09-22 16:45:32	thiago	I think there's a problem with how Xcode 8 lays the files out that Qt didn't expect
2016-09-22 16:45:36	thiago	5.7 branch?
2016-09-22 16:45:43	stefandxm	uh dunno

2016-09-22 16:47:45	thiago	yes
2016-09-22 16:47:50	stefandxm	i'd rather uninstall xcode and qmake all together
2016-09-22 16:47:57	stefandxm	and do it manually
2016-09-22 16:48:02	thiago	without xcode, how will you compile?
2016-09-22 16:48:03	stefandxm	since iam mostly targetting linux anyways
2016-09-22 16:48:08	stefandxm	thiago, with clang?

2016-09-22 16:48:30	stefandxm	xcode command line tools i guess
2016-09-22 16:48:36	thiago	so you installed xcode

2016-09-22 16:49:35	stefandxm	i dont want xcode since it is tbh complete crap
2016-09-22 16:49:48	stefandxm	for c++ that is
2016-09-22 16:50:03	thiago	you don't have to use the IDE

2016-09-22 17:05:13	stefandxm	but acoridng to some stack overflow posts tehre are some requirements for "moc" or so
2016-09-22 17:05:27	stefandxm	if so i should probably just have a look at another framework :)

2016-09-22 17:12:30	stefandxm	i read that it needs some pre-compiler "moc" ?
2016-09-22 17:12:33	thiago	you need a compiler and a linker
2016-09-22 17:12:50	thiago	with Qt 5, you don't need moc to connect signals to your own functions

2016-09-22 17:15:43	stefandxm	for me they are
2016-09-22 17:15:47	thiago	a precompiler modifies the code you write before the compiler sees it
2016-09-22 17:15:52	thiago	a code generator generates more code
2016-09-22 17:15:59	thiago	but the code you wrote is still seen by the compiler as-is

2016-09-22 17:18:31	stefandxm	i wouldnt use a hash at all then
2016-09-22 17:18:36	stefandxm	i would just enumerate them

2016-09-22 17:18:56	thiago	the point is that there is a tool that generates the hash function for you, if you pass the entire population
2016-09-22 17:19:05	stefandxm	i dont see why i need it

2016-09-22 17:20:17	thiago	on?
2016-09-22 17:21:44	thiago	anyway, tools exist to facilitate your life
2016-09-22 17:21:59	thiago	you're using cmake, not writing Makefiles by hand. Or running the compiler by hand.
2016-09-22 17:22:09	thiago	For that matter, you're using a compiler instead of writing assembly.
2016-09-22 17:22:16	thiago	moc is just a tool

2016-09-23 18:53:36	sviatoslavf	With default QStyledItemDelegate implementation, when the user begins to edit text in a QTableView (driven by a QSqlQueryModel subclass), the delegate draws a QLineEdit with the text from the model, and selects all of it for editing.
2016-09-23 18:53:37	sviatoslavf	The model text represents file names such as "document.pdf". The user is allowed to edit this entire text, however, I only want to initially highlight the base name portion ("document") and not the suffix ("pdf"). How can I do this? (I don't need the logic of how to do this, I need to know how to get the QStyledItemDelegate to highlight a portion of text)
