2016-08-04 13:27:54	danvet	agd5f, pondering a bit more I think vkms would be the way to go
2016-08-04 13:28:26	danvet	with the simple pipe helper in 4.8 you should be left with almost no code, even if you include hotplug/unplug at runtime (by adjusting e.g. the num_instances modparam)
2016-08-04 13:30:05	agd5f	danvet, vkms?  You mean move it up to a set of drm helpers?
2016-08-04 13:30:36	danvet	entire new driver, like vgem for buffer sharing
2016-08-04 13:31:06	danvet	wrote a few more lines on dri-devel in my reply
2016-08-04 13:31:24	danvet	but I think with the latest helpers and all that you should be left with almost no code to make it happen
2016-08-04 13:31:31	danvet	simple drm takes care of almost all the kms stuff
2016-08-04 13:31:44	danvet	edid forcing and connector forcing take care out output config
2016-08-04 13:32:01	danvet	a little bit of glue to make dumb mmap work on shmem gem
2016-08-04 13:32:10	danvet	plus a bit of glue for prime import/export
2016-08-04 13:32:21	danvet	if you don't bother with export even less glue
2016-08-04 13:32:33	danvet	would then work like a plugged-in udl.ko, except entirely fake
2016-08-04 13:32:34	agd5f	we'd ideally want buffers in vram
2016-08-04 13:32:42	danvet	you can have
2016-08-04 13:32:58	danvet	creat buffer on amdgpu
2016-08-04 13:33:04	danvet	import on vkms and display there
2016-08-04 13:33:15	danvet	as long as you don't dumb mmap they'll never move or anything like that
2016-08-04 13:33:28	danvet	move out of vram I mean
2016-08-04 13:33:32	danvet	since it's all fake ;-)
2016-08-04 13:33:33	agd5f	won't that require usermode changes?

2016-08-04 13:36:20	danvet	ickle, nothing else
2016-08-04 13:36:32	danvet	agd5f, well this is all under the assumption that it's entirely fake
2016-08-04 13:36:58	ickle	modesetting should be happy with the right caps
2016-08-04 13:37:51	danvet	agd5f, if it's half-fake like the i915 examples I've listed then I think it's perfectly fine in amdgpu.ko
2016-08-04 13:37:58	danvet	but entirely fake feels better in something like vkms

2016-08-04 13:38:43	agd5f	danvet, agreed.  it's mostly fake, but there are a few things we'd like to handle in the driver.
2016-08-04 13:38:46	danvet	and hrtimer for vblank isn't that much work for vkms ;-)
2016-08-04 13:38:55	danvet	agd5f, out of curiosity, which ones?

2016-08-04 13:40:03	agd5f	danvet, I guess we wouldn't have to use the virtual vblank interrupts.  The other thing would be that we need to disable the real hw bits if we use virtual displays
2016-08-04 13:40:26	agd5f	on hw that actually has display hw
2016-08-04 13:40:43	danvet	hm, what's the use case for that?
2016-08-04 13:40:50	danvet	"don't light it up" not good enough?
2016-08-04 13:41:18	danvet	in i915 we don't register the hw bits if they're not there, and otherwise meh

2016-08-04 13:43:29	agd5f	danvet, customers use chips with display hardware in servers where they want X sessions running
2016-08-04 13:44:11	danvet	yeah, we have the same
2016-08-04 13:44:23	danvet	well not X running, I think it's mostly headless EGL on gbm
2016-08-04 13:44:48	danvet	but hw is similar, there's half a gpu there with a bunch of wiring going into nowhere
2016-08-04 13:44:54	danvet	*probably similar
2016-08-04 13:45:07	danvet	we try to detect that and then just don't register anything

2016-08-04 13:45:50	agd5f	you need to expose something otherwise you can't start X unless you hack the ddx
2016-08-04 13:46:52	danvet	yeah, but I think for such entirely fake stuff vkms seems cleaner, since it should also work on wayland or wherever (once that starts happening)

2016-08-18 19:37:08	imirkin	and to be super-clear, right-handed winding == GL_CW vs GL_CCW?

2016-08-18 20:34:35	imirkin	well, my question was more like how much time *you* had already spent on it
2016-08-18 20:34:55	imirkin	but anyways, i'm sure getting it perfect takes a while
2016-08-18 20:35:14	imirkin	and having a full game working isn't exactly a reasonable first goal
2016-08-18 20:35:45	+airlied	it's a great first goal :)
2016-08-18 20:35:55	imirkin	if you say so
2016-08-18 20:36:11	+airlied	it's a lot less boring than conformance tests :)
2016-08-18 20:36:19	imirkin	i definitely wouldn't make that my first real goal
2016-08-18 20:36:25	fredrikh	i thought you already had dota 2 working :)
2016-08-18 20:36:31	imirkin	i dunno. i like conformance tests :)
2016-08-18 20:36:38	+airlied	yeah dota2 works a bit nicer than Talos
2016-08-18 20:36:40	imirkin	but i also skip them freely
2016-08-18 20:36:59	+airlied	the problem with > 100,000 conformance tests
2016-08-18 20:37:08	imirkin	is that there are 100k of them? :)
2016-08-18 20:37:17	+airlied	pretty much
2016-08-18 20:37:24	fredrikh	how many does the driver pass now?
2016-08-18 20:37:31	+airlied	so you have to add features that nobody uses just to get rid of 10,000
2016-08-18 20:37:33	+airlied	to reduec the noise
2016-08-18 20:37:46	imirkin	like texture border clamp?
2016-08-18 20:37:55	imirkin	oh wait, that's piglit
2016-08-18 20:38:27	imirkin	but yeah, conformance tests wouldn't be my first target either
2016-08-18 20:38:31	 *	airlied is just running the non-dev cts test list now
2016-08-18 20:38:33	imirkin	i'd try to cover all the reasonably small demos

2016-08-19 16:13:00	ickle	from a kernel level, we don't have much to do
2016-08-19 16:13:04	danvet	ah right, eglWaitSync is the async one
2016-08-19 16:13:17	danvet	ickle, this is all about what gl should do
2016-08-19 16:13:22	ickle	just let the user provide fences and say which to use (including whether or not to use any implicit)
2016-08-19 16:13:42	danvet	well that extension doesn't exist, we need to somehow infer it
2016-08-19 16:14:10	danvet	and what robclark & me think is that "client uses android_native_sync" -> "throw implicit sync over board"
2016-08-19 16:14:44	ickle	but gl is being provided those fences
2016-08-19 16:14:44	danvet	we could add a flag at eglimage import time to make that a bit more fine-grained, but that extension doesn't exist yet
2016-08-19 16:14:51	ickle	the native sync is just exporting
2016-08-19 16:14:57	danvet	it's also importing
2016-08-19 16:15:20	ickle	not in that spec
2016-08-19 16:15:26	danvet	    Accepted by the <attrib_list> parameter of eglCreateSyncKHR:
2016-08-19 16:15:27	danvet	    EGL_SYNC_NATIVE_FENCE_FD_ANDROID       0x3145
2016-08-19 16:15:53	danvet	hm wait
2016-08-19 16:15:56	ickle	the await part
2016-08-19 16:16:21	danvet	so I haven't tested this, but I think what you need to do is
2016-08-19 16:16:24	ickle	that just creates a sync object, to which the only thing I know that you can do is wait on
2016-08-19 16:16:36	danvet	eglWaitSync returns immediately
2016-08-19 16:16:38	ickle	(and test for signaled)
2016-08-19 16:17:05	robclark	the problem w/ per-bo flag is we have no way to know how to set it
2016-08-19 16:17:09	danvet	and with the above prop + EGL_SYNC_NATIVE_FENCE_ANDROID type fence you can import it
2016-08-19 16:17:35	danvet	robclark, like I said, the first time an android native sync fence shows up (imported or created) then set a driver-wide flag
2016-08-19 16:17:36	ickle	robclark: if you don't know, then you definitely shouldn't be opting out of implicit fences ;)
2016-08-19 16:17:46	robclark	so I think when it comes to imported bo's (not something internal to driver) once you start importing and doing async wait on fence, implicit sync goes out the window
2016-08-19 16:17:49	danvet	and from then on set that magic "don't sync with implicit fences" flag on all shared buffers
2016-08-19 16:17:55	danvet	i.e. winsys + eglimage
2016-08-19 16:18:07	danvet	robclark, yup
2016-08-19 16:18:23	robclark	ickle, that is why I call an app trying to mix implicit and explicit, as 'undefined behavior'
2016-08-19 16:18:38	danvet	ickle, no one tells us explicitly, but the android platform assumption is very much "no implicit fence on shared buffers at all"
2016-08-19 16:18:52	danvet	robclark, yeah I guess that's the only way out
2016-08-19 16:18:54	robclark	I think best thing to do is give the app a way to extract the implicit fence from a dmabuf
2016-08-19 16:18:58	ickle	then they will be passing fences
2016-08-19 16:19:02	robclark	and let the app sort it out
2016-08-19 16:19:08	danvet	at least until we have an egl extension to give eglimages a flag to again opt into implicit sync
2016-08-19 16:19:19	ickle	you should push to get those fences associated with a buffer
2016-08-19 16:19:29	danvet	ickle, it's not how it works
2016-08-19 16:19:33	ickle	or an SyncAwait
2016-08-19 16:19:43	danvet	it's called eglWaitSync apparently
2016-08-19 16:20:15	robclark	tbh, it is probably less "paperwork" to add a dmabuf ioctl to retrieve implicit fence fd than do new extension, fwiw..
2016-08-19 16:20:30	ickle	ta
2016-08-19 16:20:32	+anholt	jekstrand, Kayden: you've acked the general idea on irc, up for acking the concrete https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/103433/ patch?  It's the last thing I need for no TGSI in my main compiler path.
2016-08-19 16:20:52	danvet	robclark, well you still need the extension so that userspace can tell you when to do that ioctl call on the dma-buf
2016-08-19 16:21:11	robclark	danvet, or let app do dmabuf ioctl call
2016-08-19 16:21:17	danvet	oh, you mean userspace should just fish out the fences itself?
2016-08-19 16:21:21	robclark	right
2016-08-19 16:21:40	danvet	so yeah, after first use of android sync, implicit sync of shared stuff goes out of the window
2016-08-19 16:21:50	danvet	and mixing is undefined
2016-08-19 16:22:02	danvet	I even think we have that ioctl already, or at least talked about it
2016-08-19 16:23:32	ickle	ok, better understanding now, dropping implicit for imported upon adding the sync object to the context seems fine
2016-08-19 16:23:55	robclark	would like to hear what seanpaul/zachr/marcheu think, since I guess they are the ones with the hybrid use-case, but if app can handle fishing out the implicit fence and doing egl fence calls, that seems much easier than defining new egl extension..
2016-08-19 16:24:01	ickle	so long as that is all done in userspace, I don't mind ;)
2016-08-19 16:24:37	robclark	right, I think it needs to be done in userspace either way, thanks to how egl extensions are defined

2016-08-19 16:28:00	ickle	gl still only creates fences from the cmd stream, right?
2016-08-19 16:28:36	robclark	right.. it is all about points in time in sequence of gl/egl calls, and not about buffers
2016-08-19 16:29:54	ickle	hmm, and we get the eglDupNativeFenceFDANDROID to know when it's being exported
2016-08-19 16:30:02	robclark	right
2016-08-19 16:30:09	ickle	so we can batch up multiple fences into one cmdbuf/execbuf
2016-08-19 16:30:35	robclark	the fence fd has a merge ioctl, fwiw, so multiple incoming fences can be merged into one fence fd too..
2016-08-19 16:30:45	ickle	as well
2016-08-19 16:31:27	robclark	(partly why taking per-plane fences in atomic ioctl seemed a bit silly, but I guess that makes an easier transition path for existing atomic users, so meh)
2016-08-19 16:31:32	danvet	yeah kernel doesn't need to care beyond the per-bo flag to disable waiting on implicit fences
2016-08-19 16:31:47	ickle	we have a plan then!
2016-08-19 16:31:49	robclark	s/per-bo/per-ioctl/ ;-)
2016-08-19 16:31:57	danvet	but that then means that gl does need to keep track of depencies internally for those
2016-08-19 16:32:09	ickle	(I prefer the flexibility of per-bo and let gl do more work ;)
2016-08-19 16:32:10	danvet	if it runs on hw/sw that can schedule/reorder
2016-08-19 16:32:43	danvet	robclark, for you where everything is ordered per-ioctl might be good enough
2016-08-19 16:32:49	robclark	I'm assuming you don't reorder within a submit, you only re-order different submits
2016-08-19 16:32:59	danvet	but I guess when your gl is implicit mostly still, then per-bo is easier
2016-08-19 16:33:00	ickle	different contexts
2016-08-19 16:33:07	robclark	and true, if you can insert wait cmds in cmdstream, then merging isn't for you
2016-08-19 16:33:22	danvet	I thought different contexts still need to track fbo2texture and similar?
2016-08-19 16:33:48	robclark	yeah, imported fences are tracked per batch (which is per-context)
2016-08-19 16:34:29	robclark	fyi, mesa: https://github.com/freedreno/mesa/commits/wip-fence and libdrm: https://github.com/freedreno/libdrm/commits/fences
2016-08-19 16:34:43	danvet	worst case we get it wrong and need to fix it ;-)
2016-08-19 16:34:43	robclark	let me clean up and send out the kernel bits.. give me a few..
2016-08-19 16:35:21	robclark	danvet, btw, how do you feel about merging fence fd support for submit ioctl and atomic under modparam?
2016-08-19 16:35:26	<--	whald (~whald@ip5f5b6d22.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2016-08-19 16:35:46	robclark	that might be more convenient than keeping things on branches forever..
2016-08-19 16:36:18	robclark	(ie. similar to what we did w/ atomic ioctl initially)
2016-08-19 16:36:25	danvet	robclark, for submit I see no reason to keep it out, since it's a normal egl extension, and we can write piglits for that
2016-08-19 16:36:27	ickle	I was thinking you would be keeping an array of in-fence-fd and merging once
2016-08-19 16:36:34	danvet	for atomic I do think we should wait for the hwc2 release
2016-08-19 16:36:56	danvet	but yeah if google keeps stalling we might want to merge it
2016-08-19 16:37:05	robclark	ok, I guess I care more about submit ioctl since that would be holding up libdrm and mesa bits..
2016-08-19 16:37:07	danvet	but I thought there's still some de-staging work pending from padovan?
2016-08-19 16:37:17	danvet	gregkh unfortunately isn't all that fast
2016-08-19 16:37:31	danvet	robclark, yeah for submit I think make sure you have solid piglits
2016-08-19 16:37:40	danvet	get them reviewed by some googler and we're good to go

2016-08-19 16:37:57	danvet	assuming there's some tests in there
2016-08-19 16:38:00	robclark	ickle, instead of array of in-fence-fd (at least for gpu's that aren't waiting in cmdstream) userspace would just merge the fence fd's..

2016-08-19 16:39:04	robclark	danvet, but seriously, I don't think the uapi is likely to change for me (since tiler.. there is no such thing as single point in cmdstream).. although hiding it under modparam until we have better tests would be ok with me..

2016-08-19 16:40:52	robclark	anyways, I kinda have a big pile of a5xx that I need to get started on, so not really sure when I'll have time to write piglits.. but would be nice to not have big pile of libdrm and mesa patches in limbo forever..

2016-08-19 16:59:40	marcheu	robclark: how would the app know that it has to extract a fence?
2016-08-19 17:00:06	robclark	how would the driver know?
2016-08-19 17:00:35	robclark	if app is using explicit fence for some imported buffers, then it should be able to figure it out.. app certainly doesn't have *less* info than driver
2016-08-19 17:00:36	marcheu	it doesn't, implicit and explicit fences are both struct fence in the kernel
2016-08-19 17:01:18	robclark	anyways, app might have association of dmabuf and fence.. but behind egl the driver certainly doesn't
2016-08-19 17:01:49	marcheu	anyway we already have hybrid implicit/explicit if needed
2016-08-19 17:01:55	robclark	so if app can't do it, no one can..  I mean the alternative is invent some extension where app can set a "pls_implicit_fence_this_eglimg" flag
2016-08-19 17:02:03	robclark	but then driver just ends up doing what app could do..
2016-08-19 17:02:04	marcheu	no only the kernel can do it...
2016-08-19 17:02:25	marcheu	that's the only place where all fences are just a struct fence
2016-08-19 17:02:47	robclark	how?  fences are already decoupled from bo's in the driver, kernel isn't going to be able to piece it back together..
2016-08-19 17:03:08	marcheu	we have a reservation object to store them
2016-08-19 17:03:19	marcheu	getting them either from the dmabuf metadata or from the driver
2016-08-19 17:03:25	marcheu	then you handle them all as a single thing
2016-08-19 17:03:43	robclark	right, but then you end up doing both implicit and explicit blocking.. so precludes any sort of sub-buffer thing..
2016-08-19 17:04:09	marcheu	why?
2016-08-19 17:04:30	robclark	part of point of explicit is to not block in cases where implicit would tell you to block
2016-08-19 17:04:47	marcheu	we only have implicit fences on buffers which are shared between drivers
2016-08-19 17:04:55	robclark	marcheu, anyways, the compositor should still have the association of buffer and fence..
2016-08-19 17:05:08	robclark	the proposal was to have a dmabuf ioctl
2016-08-19 17:05:13	robclark	to fish out the implicit fence fd

2016-08-19 17:05:32	robclark	so compositor doing explicit fence can get an fence fd from a dmabuf fd if client didnt' already pass it one

2016-08-19 17:06:22	robclark	ie. if you get a dmabuf fd from v4l2 but it doesn't give you a fence, then ioctl(dmabuf_fd, DMABUF_GET_IMPLICIT_FENCE, &arg)
2016-08-19 17:06:28	robclark	or something like that

2016-09-14 11:43:02	robclark	anholt, hmm, why not use bitmask to track jobs/batches for shuffle/reorder?  Seems cheaper than looping over all the jobs and all of their bo's
2016-09-14 11:44:37	+anholt	robclark: I should certainly have a hash, not that stupid linked list
2016-09-14 11:44:52	+anholt	but screwing around with bitmasks vs hashes, meh.  would need to see some performance data.
2016-09-14 11:45:11	+anholt	and given that my stupid array isn't showing up in profiles, that seems unlikely.
2016-09-14 11:45:22	robclark	if you limit to 32 or 64 jobs/batches (which imo seems reasonable) then bitmask is cheap and cheerful..
2016-09-14 11:45:39	robclark	(and less memory allocation by not having a hashset per resource)

2016-09-14 12:16:04	robclark	anholt, hmm, that sounds insufficient, but I didn't look too closely at your patch..  you need to know both N jobs that read from a resource and 1 job that writes resource.. both for transfer_map and to get the dependencies between jobs right..

2016-09-14 12:19:06	+anholt	robclark: yeah.  so my reads suck datastructure-wise right now, except that I'm *also* walking this array on every single read draw operation, not just at write transfers.
2016-09-14 12:19:51	+anholt	so I need to change the array to a hash in the job.  and I think once I do that, write transfers / new write job spawning should just walk all jobs (there aren't many) and look up in their hashes
2016-09-14 12:20:39	robclark	hmm, ok, so transfer_map(READ) would potentially flush things that don't need flushing?  Well, I guess that isn't a case to optimize for anyways..
2016-09-14 12:21:03	+anholt	transfer_map(read) flushes write jobs to that rsc

2016-09-14 12:43:16	robclark	anholt, btw, do you do resource shadowing yet, like creating a 2nd copy of a texture/ubo if it gets updated mid-batch?  For gfxbench and stk that was actually the bigger win (and the re-ordering was mostly useful because of u_blitter to copy stuff from old->new bo)

2016-09-14 12:47:47	robclark	I could probably handle more cases but haven't come up with a reason yet..  the partial PIPE_BUFFER case was needed for UBO updates

2016-09-14 13:17:59	HdkR	Right, the idea would be just using Linux since Android is always a bit meh
2016-09-14 13:18:30	HdkR	Sounds like I should figure out how to set up an AArch64 qemu guest
2016-09-14 13:18:36	HdkR	with virgil3d support
2016-09-14 13:19:15	robher	My build can target x86, arm or arm64.
2016-09-14 13:19:32	robher	https://github.com/robherring/generic_device/wiki/KConfig-based-Multi-platform-Android-Device-(and-Mesa-graphics)
2016-09-14 13:20:24	HdkR	Nice
2016-09-14 13:20:55	robher	HdkR: You won't be the first to do it. Someone else has done the same on Tegra IIRC.
2016-09-14 13:21:54	HdkR	Trying to give people more chances to develop for the AArch64 version of Dolphin without having to own an Android phone. Qemu is a good path for it
2016-09-14 13:22:53	HdkR	What are the GL version limitations of virgil?
2016-09-14 13:23:38	imirkin_	no tess, so GL 3.3 + various exts
2016-09-14 13:23:47	HdkR	That's reasonable
2016-09-14 13:24:01	HdkR	Better than the Android emulator by a long shot
2016-09-14 13:24:03	imirkin_	i saw airlied has a branch for GL 4.1 available, although it seems be largely hacky
2016-09-14 13:24:22	imirkin_	(i.e. various functionality is purposefully not implemented)
2016-09-14 13:25:34	HdkR	I presume performance of virgil is quite a bit better than the Android Emulator's nasty GL renderer?
2016-09-14 13:27:39	imirkin_	dunno about android emulator, but afaik virgl perf is comparable to regular system perf (but obviously lower)
2016-09-14 13:28:30	HdkR	If I'm recalling from the last time I was testing perf of the Android Emulator renderer, I was seeing something like 1/3rd the perf of host
2016-09-14 13:28:49	HdkR	This was roughly three years ago over the socket interface, not the pipe interface
2016-09-14 13:29:02	imirkin_	give it a try and see?
2016-09-14 13:29:26	imirkin_	should work with the blob driver that you so love
2016-09-14 13:29:30	HdkR	:P
2016-09-14 13:29:48	HdkR	imirkin_: You're giving me less and less reasons to use it
2016-09-14 13:30:24	imirkin_	well, nouveau's kinda dead in the water for maxwell2+, so i'm sure that'll change soon
2016-09-14 13:30:39	HdkR	My laptop's GPU is kepler, so not really a big issue
2016-09-14 13:31:13	HdkR	K2100M
2016-09-14 13:31:21	imirkin_	GK104/GK106?
2016-09-14 13:31:27	HdkR	GK106 yea
2016-09-14 13:31:35	imirkin_	that should work reasonably well
2016-09-14 13:31:45	HdkR	Is reclocking an issue still?
2016-09-14 13:32:02	imirkin_	not in mainline kernel yet, but should be in v4.9
2016-09-14 13:32:09	imirkin_	i mean, it's there, but it most likely won't work
2016-09-14 13:32:15	imirkin_	but in v4.9 it should actually work
2016-09-14 13:32:20	HdkR	Oh interesting

2016-09-14 13:46:30	+idr	ajax: Maybe?  Lol
2016-09-14 13:46:37	imirkin_	Kayden: unrelatedly, looks like RESET_NOTIFICATION_STRATEGY should have been exposed in ES as part of KHR_robustness. although it explicitly says that CONTEXT_FLAGS is left to desktop-only.
2016-09-14 13:47:35	imirkin_	while ES 3.2 adds it in as part of robust buffer access.

2016-09-14 13:47:52	imirkin_	i wonder if there's a KHR_robust_buffer_access we skipped over
2016-09-14 13:48:15	Kayden	there is, and we support it,
2016-09-14 13:48:25	imirkin_	hm, there's GL_KHR_robust_buffer_access_behavior but that still doesn't add CONTEXT_FLAGS.
2016-09-14 13:48:26	Kayden	but it says CONTEXT_FLAGS is dropped
2016-09-14 13:49:07	imirkin_	ok. so CONTEXT_FLAGS really is an ES 3.2 thing [as far as ES goes]
2016-09-14 13:52:05	robclark	imirkin, and ironically gmail tends to make it kind of a pain to trim..  or at least shift + pg-up/pg-down doesn't work..
2016-09-14 13:53:30	+ajax	tbf, so does evolution

2016-09-14 13:53:45	+ajax	but that's because evo's composer is webkit, and webkit sucks

2016-09-14 23:25:28	+airlied	so yeah R5 240 is probably the lowest
2016-09-14 23:25:50	+airlied	R5 330 or R5 340
2016-09-14 23:46:08	+MrCooper	imirkin: the semantics of PIPE_BIND_SHARED and PIPE_BIND_LINEAR haven't changed as you suggest, but I think the real question is why PIPE_BIND_LINEAR is being used for buffers which aren't being shared between GPUs

2016-09-14 23:47:33	 *	airlied assume something in the vdpau code wants it
2016-09-14 23:47:44	+airlied	or maybe radeon vdpau doesn't like tiling so it gets set up there
2016-09-14 23:51:17	imirkin	semantics are pretty wishy-washy in the "docs", so they're effectively defined by the users. users changed, so semantics changed.
2016-09-14 23:53:50	+airlied	imirkin: can you remove LINEAR in output.c and see if stuff breaks?
2016-09-14 23:53:59	imirkin	mmmm sec
2016-09-14 23:54:40	+airlied	since I'd expect dropping LINEAR makes more sense than dropping SHARED
2016-09-14 23:55:09	imirkin	gr, have to rebuild all of mesa. more like "a couple min"
2016-09-14 23:55:49	+airlied	since that was added to fix radeonsi
2016-09-14 23:55:58	+airlied	which to me seems to be radeon specific
2016-09-14 23:56:35	imirkin	well, afaik it's for making the surface available via dma-buf
2016-09-14 23:57:01	imirkin	which somehow interacts with NV_vdpau_interop? dunno
2016-09-14 23:57:10	imirkin	that's what the change was all about it seems though
2016-09-14 23:58:18	+airlied	well the change that introduced LINEAR said it was radeonsi workaround
2016-09-14 23:58:25	+airlied	I just sent a patch
2016-09-14 23:58:39	imirkin	airlied: seems to work
2016-09-14 23:58:53	+airlied	now you can go make your point about radeon-specific hacks :)
2016-09-15 00:00:55	+airlied	bnieuwenhuizen: got vkquake master rendering with radv (not perfect)
2016-09-15 00:01:30	imirkin	i dunno - if i had to choose, i'd rather nouveau be broken than radeon. a lot more users of radeon, plus the thing actually works
2016-09-15 00:02:10	+airlied	I'd rather the code used the correct flags :)
2016-09-15 00:02:19	+airlied	so when we change things, random shit doesn't break
2016-09-15 00:02:35	imirkin	that'd be nice too :)
2016-09-15 00:02:55	+airlied	I'm gussing it's possible the dmabuf interop thing makes the need for LINEAR go away on radeonsi
2016-09-15 00:03:09	+airlied	but that's just a guess that hopefylly the AMD guys can answer
2016-09-15 00:03:16	 *	airlied has never had vdpau anything
2016-09-15 00:03:34	+airlied	bnieuwenhuizen: semi-interesting-input-attachment-wip branch
2016-09-15 00:05:34	+MrCooper	imirkin: it's quite clear to me: one means a buffer can be shared, the other means the buffer layout is linear; you had a good run getting away with an incorrect assumption about the combination of the two, but now it's over
2016-09-15 00:05:56	imirkin	MrCooper: a very good run :)
2016-09-15 00:06:28	+airlied	MrCooper: well you guys got a good run of a patch that was radeonsi specific, but now it's over :)
2016-09-15 00:07:24	+airlied	linear doesn't make sense there at all
2016-09-15 00:10:37	<--	fredrikh (~fredrik@kde/fredrik) has quit (Quit: bbl)
2016-09-15 00:11:25	imirkin	to be clear - i think there are very few users of vdpau on nouveau. it requires (a) non-redistributable firmware and (b) dealing with some videos misrendering and (c) only using mplayer [at least mpv is multithreaded]
2016-09-15 00:16:43	skeggsb	imirkin: why does the mesa driver force gart exclusively for that case btw?
2016-09-15 00:17:14	imirkin	skeggsb: nouveau 0000:04:00.0: DRM: Moving pinned object ffff88009503fc00!
2016-09-15 00:17:51	imirkin	i get that otherwise
2016-09-15 00:17:58	imirkin	when doing DRI3 prime
2016-09-15 00:18:10	imirkin	[and i assume DRI2 prime as well, but i haven't tested]
2016-09-15 00:18:26	skeggsb	what was the exact change you made?
2016-09-15 00:18:48	imirkin	skeggsb: and bo's can't be GART|VRAM on nv50+, i think
2016-09-15 00:19:09	skeggsb	they can, but the kernel will force small pages for them
2016-09-15 00:19:14	imirkin	skeggsb: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/110553/
2016-09-15 00:19:17	skeggsb	(because of nv50/g8x/g9x limitations)
2016-09-15 00:19:32	imirkin	skeggsb: pretty sure there's a thing that enforces that only one is set
2016-09-15 00:19:36	imirkin	that's why we had all those suspend/resume errors
2016-09-15 00:19:51	+airlied	really DRI2/3 should probably grow a OTHER_GPU flags if possible

2016-09-15 00:20:36	skeggsb	imirkin: hmm, i don't believe that's the case, just a "if allocated with only one flag set, disallow the other"
2016-09-15 00:20:48	imirkin	ah, that could be...
2016-09-15 00:21:56	imirkin	skeggsb: in nouveau_gem_new it does nvbo->valid_domains &= domain
2016-09-15 00:22:16	imirkin	but i guess domain could be multiple things?
2016-09-15 00:22:20	skeggsb	yep
2016-09-15 00:22:55	skeggsb	you can call libdrm bo_new with VRAM|GART, and it'll be allowed in either
2016-09-15 00:23:11	imirkin	and is there a way to request its placement?
2016-09-15 00:23:25	imirkin	or rather, prefer? like in that pushbuf submit thing?
2016-09-15 00:23:57	skeggsb	you won't get large pages though, which means no compression or zbc support - something which will be relaxed for >=fermi in the not-too-distant future, since its mmu doesn't suck as badly as tesla's
2016-09-15 00:25:02	skeggsb	yeah, the flags you pass in the buffer list at command submission time can move it
2016-09-15 00:25:37	skeggsb	i do wonder why the buffer is getting pinned, however..
2016-09-15 00:26:11	imirkin	hm, ok. well i guess we could try allocating the buffer with both in the shared case
2016-09-15 00:26:26	imirkin	and if you try rendering to it, request that it be moved to vram?

2016-09-15 10:43:39	zgreg	imirkin: nvidia's Vulkan driver exposes 16 graphics capable queues. do you know what the actual hardware capabilities are? most GPUs only seem to have a single graphics queue in hardware.

2016-09-15 10:47:53	imirkin_	zgreg: not sure what a queue is.
2016-09-15 10:48:14	+ajax	i assume they're a direct mapping to the hardware contexts or channels or whatever they're called
2016-09-15 10:48:50	imirkin_	yeah, could be that each one is a hwcontext, but switching between contexts is fairly expensive
2016-09-15 10:49:01	imirkin_	16 doesn't come up as a limit i remember though
2016-09-15 10:49:36	bnieuwenhuizen	imirkin_: so presumably for nvidia you build buffers with commands too? Then having 16 queues is like being able to process 16 command buffers at the same time /interleaved *
2016-09-15 10:50:08	bnieuwenhuizen	at least conceptually, it can be simulated by scheduling them after each other on a single hardware queue
2016-09-15 10:50:21	imirkin_	well.... there's still one engine processing the commands. you can't just "interleave" those commands, they'd have to be attached to a separate context in order to make sense

2016-09-15 10:50:40	imirkin_	or to start out with giant reset sequences each time
2016-09-15 10:50:46	imirkin_	to zero out any state set by previous commands
2016-09-15 10:50:58	zgreg	imirkin_: some on-chip engine that processes commands of some type, e.g. draw commands and related state updates
2016-09-15 10:51:06	imirkin_	PFIFO would be that engine
2016-09-15 10:51:15	imirkin_	it processes commands, and then sends them out to the relevant engine
2016-09-15 10:51:50	imirkin_	(which engine is determined by the subchannel of the command, engine classes are bound to specific subchannels earlier on)
2016-09-15 10:51:56	zgreg	16 graphics queues just sounds unlikely, that would basically mean 16 graphics engines capable of processing draw commands...
2016-09-15 10:52:14	imirkin_	more likely what ajax said - each one is a separate channel/hwcontext
2016-09-15 10:52:29	zgreg	so my suspicion is that nvidia's vulkan uses some abstraction here
2016-09-15 10:52:55	imirkin_	that could be too - they could track what state they have to unfuck between each queue "switch"
2016-09-15 10:53:14	imirkin_	should be pretty easy to determine with a mmt trace
2016-09-15 10:53:36	zgreg	how many PFIFOs are usually found on nvidia GPUs, btw?
2016-09-15 10:53:42	imirkin_	1
2016-09-15 10:53:49	zgreg	oh... okay
2016-09-15 10:54:14	zgreg	that doesn't sound very flexible
2016-09-15 10:54:30	imirkin_	i guess ... seems to work ok for them though
2016-09-15 10:54:47	zgreg	maybe one of the reasons why async compute tends to suck
2016-09-15 10:54:49	bnieuwenhuizen	IIRC nvidia has a reputation for being bad at async compute, which is pretty much doing stuff on separate compute queues. Needing context switches would explain some of the slowness
2016-09-15 10:55:23	imirkin_	note that the context switch is in the "PGRAPH" engine, not PFIFO
2016-09-15 10:56:02	imirkin_	the PGRAPH engine contains basically all the 2d/3d logic
2016-09-15 10:56:24	imirkin_	there are also copy engines, and ... that's about it. (well, also video decoding, other bs like that)
2016-09-15 10:56:28	zgreg	it's not only context switches, I'd guess. if you submit a compute job, the PFIFO will have to chew through all currently queued commands before getting to the new compute job
2016-09-15 10:56:42	imirkin_	nah, you point it at a different queue
2016-09-15 10:56:52	imirkin_	in conjunction with the context switch
2016-09-15 10:57:39	zgreg	hm, I don't get it. it's a FIFO, isn't it? so if there is a bunch of stuff in the FIFO, it will be processed in order.
2016-09-15 10:57:49	imirkin_	btw, please take these details with a grain of salt. i only have a cursory understanding of how it's all hooked up. skeggsb and mwk would be able to say with much more authority.
2016-09-15 10:58:05	imirkin_	the FIFO processes stuff in order
2016-09-15 10:58:10	imirkin_	it dispatches commands to the engine
2016-09-15 10:58:19	imirkin_	which can then do whatever it pleases with those commands
2016-09-15 10:58:42	imirkin_	all the out-of-order-ness is inside of the engine, as i understand it
2016-09-15 10:58:48	zgreg	so I suppose it's not synchronous

2016-09-15 10:59:00	imirkin_	also you can't have a context switch while PGRAPH is actively drawing
2016-09-15 10:59:44	imirkin_	it prefetches from command buffers if that's what you mean, but that's just bytes, so largely meaningless.

2016-09-15 11:11:35	+ajax	of course there is
2016-09-15 11:11:39	+ajax	that's how hdcp works
2016-09-15 11:11:46	+ajax	for very small values of "works"
2016-09-15 11:13:39	zgreg	really? HDPC uses a different cipher and it should be implemented somewhere in the display engine, no?
2016-09-15 11:14:45	imirkin_	it's definitely hdcp-related
2016-09-15 11:14:55	imirkin_	for decrypting encrypted videos or some shit like that
2016-09-15 11:14:59	zgreg	AFAIR, the BD encryption uses AES, maybe in a "protected" playback scheme the OS simply passes an encrypted video stream to the GPU and the rest is done by the GPU
2016-09-15 11:17:07	zgreg	that would be pretty perfect. no access to unencrypted compressed video and very hard to get hold of decoded frames

2016-09-15 11:18:27	zgreg	if nvidia is evil, they could even have the decoder watermark the images, so if anyone finds a workaround to somehow fetch decoded frames from GPU memory, they can find out
2016-09-15 11:19:27	zgreg	if I was evil, I'd certainly do that

2016-09-15 16:41:44	karolherbst	I would like to implement things needed to expose "free vram" through existing (E)GL(X) extensions for a gallium driver (nouveau in this case). What would be the simpliest way to do that? I guess there is some kind of internal gallium API which need to be implemented?
2016-09-15 16:42:02	karolherbst	or is there something more generic already done through other means and it just requires something inside the kernel
2016-09-15 16:42:32	+idr	karolherbst: Possibly... but I think mareko already did some of that for the ATI extension.
2016-09-15 16:43:16	karolherbst	yeah, I am kind of aware that _some_ drivers expose information like that already
2016-09-15 16:43:21	imirkin_	karolherbst: look at what radeon does. there are gallium calls which expose data for both the ATI and NV exts
2016-09-15 16:43:23	karolherbst	no idea how though and no idea which ones
2016-09-15 16:44:09	imirkin_	pipe_screen->query_memory_info()
2016-09-15 16:44:24	imirkin_	which is supposed to fill in a pipe_memory_info struct
2016-09-15 16:44:40	imirkin_	which is defined here: https://cgit.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/tree/src/gallium/include/pipe/p_state.h#n827
2016-09-15 16:44:43	karolherbst	I guess we just fill in the total vram amount?
2016-09-15 16:45:16	imirkin_	nope, a bunch of stuff needs to be added, that's why i never implemented it.
2016-09-15 16:45:50	karolherbst	ohh the GLX_MESA_query_renderer uses a different struct?
2016-09-15 16:46:11	imirkin_	yep
2016-09-15 16:46:25	karolherbst	... isn't it the same like total_device_memory what gets exposed there?
2016-09-15 16:47:24	imirkin_	nope. there are a bunch more fields.
2016-09-15 16:47:52	imirkin_	(look at the struct i pointed you to. it's all documented there.)
2016-09-15 16:47:53	karolherbst	yeah I know, but it might have made more sense to design the API in a way, that all things would use the same struct in the end
2016-09-15 16:48:04	imirkin_	maybe.
2016-09-15 16:48:15	imirkin_	don't see why it really matters
2016-09-15 16:48:30	karolherbst	what would be the thing for GLX_MESA_query_renderer?
2016-09-15 16:48:40	imirkin_	PIPE_CAP_VIDEO_MEMORY iirc
2016-09-15 16:48:54	imirkin_	(rtfs?)
2016-09-15 16:49:25	+ajax	surely "free video memory" is the most transient of statistics
2016-09-15 16:49:39	imirkin_	ajax: and the most interesting to applications

2016-09-15 16:51:11	robertfoss	seanpaul: it isn't actually in the code, but it seems to be needed due to a few defines: DRM_REFLECT_X, DRM_REFLECT_Y, DRM_ROTATE_XXX

2016-09-15 16:52:04	seanpaul	robertfoss: i'm guessing those defines were dropped into one of the libdrm headers

2016-09-15 17:06:06	mareko	karolherbst: for "free video memory", r600 and radeonsi report max(VRAM size - the amount of VRAM requested, 0)
2016-09-15 17:06:30	mareko	imirkin_: nr_evictions is from the NV extension
2016-09-15 17:07:20	karolherbst	mareko: yeah right, but you have a radeon interface for that, right? I kind of hoped there would be some drm generic thing, cause it would make somehow sense
2016-09-15 17:07:41	karolherbst	but then again, I have no idea what would be valid inside drm core
2016-09-15 17:08:39	mareko	karolherbst: the kernel is not used for "free video memory", the driver just counts pipe_resources in VRAM
2016-09-15 17:09:00	imirkin_	karolherbst: i think we count in libdrm somewhere
2016-09-15 17:09:12	karolherbst	imirkin_: uhh, that would be nice
2016-09-15 17:09:31	karolherbst	imirkin_: then I would guess we could also count the amount of evicitions there too
2016-09-15 17:09:47	karolherbst	I saw that also radeon cheats there a little regarding nr_device_memory_evictions
2016-09-15 17:10:54	karolherbst	mareko: we just found an application today counting textures for clearing their cache, and their threshold is like 128000 textures. And then I was thinking: nobody should do silly thinks like that

2016-09-15 17:12:16	mareko	the real free VRAM is kinda random... first you don't know how many apps are competing for VRAM space, evictions can cause a temporary drop in VRAM usage (amdgpu fills unused VRAM more quickly though), and finally, the kernel deallocates buffers only when it needs free space, so VRAM usage can be consistenly 50% even if there is no reason for it
2016-09-15 17:13:35	karolherbst	mhh but is there no way to keep track of "actively used" vram?
2016-09-15 17:14:33	mareko	that depends on the definition of "actively used"
2016-09-15 17:14:47	karolherbst	anyway, I am sure we will need that more and more if it keeps up with the game releases like it does today
2016-09-15 17:14:58	karolherbst	well can't be fred, cause it is used
2016-09-15 17:15:22	imirkin_	"used" is relative :)
2016-09-15 17:15:24	karolherbst	or evicted or whatever the right term would be here
2016-09-15 17:15:27	mareko	no, there is no way to get that information at the moment
2016-09-15 17:15:58	karolherbst	so within the kernel we don't know which parts of ram are in active used by clients and the module itself?
2016-09-15 17:16:24	mareko	loop over all buffers and check which fences are unsignalled?
2016-09-15 17:16:39	+ajax	it's probably _possible_ to compute a sum
2016-09-15 17:16:45	+ajax	it probably isn't already computed
2016-09-15 17:17:41	karolherbst	I am still convinced we need to provide applications with rather accurate information these days, especially if there are applications soley using 4GB of vram
2016-09-15 17:17:59	karolherbst	(or 16GB, like in the case we found today)
2016-09-15 17:18:26	mareko	why would you need to know the real free vram anyway
2016-09-15 17:18:39	karolherbst	applications might want to drop caches
2016-09-15 17:18:47	mareko	or might not
2016-09-15 17:18:55	karolherbst	well if there is no vram, you want
2016-09-15 17:19:10	karolherbst	you could just try to allocate like 16GB instead, but why should you do that?
2016-09-15 17:19:37	karolherbst	fact is, application might do all kind of silly things
2016-09-15 17:19:40	mareko	implement the ATI and NVX extensions and see if it helps
2016-09-15 17:19:50	karolherbst	and if they want to fill vram with their data as caches, why shouldn't they?

2016-09-15 17:21:16	karolherbst	right, and thats why we need reliable data there
2016-09-15 17:21:50	mareko	just return 0 free VRAM when you don't know

2016-09-15 17:22:25	mareko	radeon doesn't need accurate stats AFAIK
2016-09-15 17:23:46	mareko	or apps can query the total memory size and do the counting by themselves
2016-09-15 17:23:57	karolherbst	which isn't reliable
2016-09-15 17:24:11	karolherbst	how should they know how much vram gets actually used?

2016-09-15 17:24:28	karolherbst	it does

2016-09-15 17:25:17	karolherbst	not saying it's their fault though
2016-09-15 17:25:37	karolherbst	cause per texture nouveau allocates like 128kb, for each or so we think
2016-09-15 17:25:48	karolherbst	anyway, if those textures are really just 8kb big, you are in trouble
2016-09-15 17:26:13	mareko	if an app can fit all its buffers in VRAM, it's the ideal scenario, but we generally allow apps to use VRAM size + GTT size + swap size
2016-09-15 17:26:23	mareko	and the per-draw call limit is VRAM size + GTT size * 0.7
2016-09-15 17:26:30	karolherbst	right, with bad performance that is I suppose
2016-09-15 17:26:42	mareko	not really
2016-09-15 17:26:54	mareko	it's bad with swap, it's not so bad with GTT

2016-09-15 17:32:31	karolherbst	right, but we don't really have a list of the important things, right? at least I don't know one besides trello and there aren't exactly "critical" things like that

2016-09-15 21:54:21	bnieuwenhuizen	jekstrand: why are phis converted to variables instead of directly converting the phi's to nir phi's? The source has a comment about needing dominance information, but I don't see why you need that for direct conversion.
2016-09-15 21:59:54	kisak	hmm ... apparently google released a performance oriented etc compression library at https://github.com/google/etc2comp
2016-09-15 22:00:08	kisak	is such a thing interesting as an optional dependency to mesa?

2016-09-15 22:14:38	jekstrand	bnieuwenhuizen: I don't remmber the precise details.  What i do remember is that the conversion isn't quite 1-1 because of where NIR places phis.
2016-09-15 22:15:15	jekstrand	bnieuwenhuizen: Because of that, we would end up having to run some algorithm for placing the phis where NIR wants them.  That algorithm is identical to nir_lower_vars_to_ssa so...
2016-09-15 22:16:24	jekstrand	bnieuwenhuizen: On top of that, SPIR-V's phis are not restricted to vectors so there would have been a pile of code to emit multiple phis.  At one point, all that code did exist; cwabbott wrote it.  However, I ended up getting rid of it because it didn't quite work correctly.
2016-09-15 22:17:02	jekstrand	bnieuwenhuizen: I wouldn't be opposed to translating SPIR-V phis directly into NIR phis but it's a lot of code that's tricky to get right and just making them variables was way easier and correct.

2016-09-15 22:40:37	 *	jekstrand wonders when glslang started outputting phis
2016-09-15 22:45:12	+airlied	so if we get an empty if block do we just point block end at the toplevel?
2016-09-15 22:45:18	+airlied	end_block
2016-09-15 22:45:41	 *	airlied is slowly catching up on not being a compiler IR person
2016-09-15 22:45:51	bnieuwenhuizen	so I think if we get an empty if block, the predecessor points to the block containing the conditional branch
2016-09-15 22:46:54	 *	jekstrand resurrects is spirv2nir binary to start investigating
2016-09-15 22:47:22	bnieuwenhuizen	and the problem is that we spir-v block maps to the wrong nir block (should map to the block before the if node if I understand nir correctly)
2016-09-15 22:56:20	 *	jekstrand has a theory...

2016-09-16 00:15:35	jekstrand	airlied: ok, two new patches on the list
2016-09-16 00:16:01	jekstrand	Kayden: Because, thanks to the way block splitting works, you can't just save off a block pointer and trust it to be what you want after you've inserted more cf_nodes.
2016-09-16 00:16:22	jekstrand	Kayden: However, if you insert a nop and save a pointer to the nop, it will stay exactly where you left it because it's an instruction.
2016-09-16 00:18:25	jekstrand	airlied: I kicked it off to jenkins.  I have a feeling this may actually fix some CTS tests
2016-09-16 00:19:12	Kayden	right, okay, that makes sense
2016-09-16 00:19:23	jekstrand	I thought it was a rather clever way to get around the problem.
2016-09-16 00:19:44	Kayden	I could have used that in brw_nir_tcs_workarounds.c to avoid the "all the predecessors of the end_block changed" problem.
2016-09-16 00:19:53	Kayden	instead of having to save off the list
2016-09-16 00:20:20	Kayden	(I originally just inserted a constant zero and assumed it'd get dead code eliminated)
2016-09-16 00:20:40	jekstrand	I suppose a constant works too
2016-09-16 00:20:41	Kayden	ah, saving the pointer to the nop, though
2016-09-16 00:20:46	jekstrand	There are many forms of nop
2016-09-16 00:21:10	jekstrand	Hrm... I don't know if I want CAN_REORDER...

2016-09-16 00:24:02	jekstrand	airlied: If you wanted to be really complete, you'd write a little crucible test :P
2016-09-16 00:25:05	jekstrand	airlied: I suppose you're handling it as a storage image then?

2016-09-16 00:27:40	+airlied	you might want to do the frag pos addition in nir as well
2016-09-16 00:27:48	+airlied	it was pretty easy for me to put it in my image_load code
2016-09-16 00:29:00	+airlied	jekstrand: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97233 is a bug report for this btw
2016-09-16 00:29:07	jekstrand	airlied: It should be easy to write the lowering pass.  It's just a matter of seeing image_load+GLSL_SAMPLER_DIM_SUBPASS and switching it over to a texelfetch

2016-09-16 01:12:34	tarceri	looking at the unroll pass again I can see at least one case where I abuse the hash table to hold a value-pair do we have a util for that or do we just normally use a list
2016-09-16 01:12:55	jekstrand	What do you mean?
2016-09-16 01:13:59	tarceri	I just want to hold sets of two pointers, wondering if we have a generic util for that
2016-09-16 01:14:23	jekstrand	Not really
2016-09-16 01:14:48	cwabbott	jekstrand: i don't know how i feel about your rfc... the thing that concerns me is that it feels like just shifting the problem around, before the rule was "don't touch the basic block at all," now you have to think about whether you want the cursor to be before or after the basic block and one of those is still annoying to do
2016-09-16 01:15:11	cwabbott	and as to adding a nop instruction... no, that seems like a gross hack to me
2016-09-16 01:15:15	jekstrand	cwabbott: Yeah, i think they break things as well.
2016-09-16 01:15:29	jekstrand	cwabbott: See the two non-RFC patches I sent for how I worked around the problem I was having with it.
2016-09-16 01:15:30	cwabbott	i need to think about it some more, but i'm going to bed now
2016-09-16 01:15:42	jekstrand	cwabbott: In the end, I think I like my nop trick a whole lot better.
2016-09-16 01:16:05	cwabbott	the thing is, it's kinda abusing an implementation detail of how blocks are split
2016-09-16 01:16:13	jekstrand	It is
2016-09-16 01:16:20	cwabbott	this isn't what i had in mind at all when i wrote it
2016-09-16 01:16:26	jekstrand	Hence tagging with a nop rather than storing a block pointer.
2016-09-16 01:16:55	cwabbott	i mean, tagging with a nop is still doing that...
2016-09-16 01:17:01	jekstrand	How?
2016-09-16 01:17:18	jekstrand	The thing that the control flow code guarantees is that instructions stay where you think they are.
2016-09-16 01:17:54	cwabbott	ok... but still, there should be a better way
2016-09-16 01:17:56	jekstrand	It doesn't guarantee that block pointers are what they are but it does guarantee that, no matter what it does with the underlying blocks, it will ensure that instructions land in the right blocks.
2016-09-16 01:18:09	jekstrand	cwabbott: Maybe there is.
2016-09-16 01:18:28	jekstrand	cwabbott: If you've got a better way to solve the problem of tagging a block as you build IR, I'm all ears.
2016-09-16 01:19:12	cwabbott	i was thinking about having insert/extract return cursor(s) that you use to "replace" the cursor(s) that you pass in
2016-09-16 01:19:32	cwabbott	extract would return just one, insert would return before/after

2016-09-16 01:19:59	jekstrand	cwabbott: Sure, but the problem with spirv_to_nir is that by the time I'm inserting the nir_if or nir_loop, I've moved past the handling of that vtn_block on to something else.
2016-09-16 01:20:13	jekstrand	So I would have to store the last know vtn_block and patch it up after I insert more cf_nodes
2016-09-16 01:20:22	jekstrand	What I really want to do is tag the block and move on.
2016-09-16 01:20:42	cwabbott	i need to look at spirv_to_nir tomorrow to see what's going on
2016-09-16 01:20:47	jekstrand	Storing the pointer doesn't work because later IR manipulations may make it bogus.

2016-09-16 05:34:10	+anholt	Kayden, jekstrand: Have you guys looked into doing CL on top of the stuff you've built at this point?  Or is CL just dead from your perspective?
2016-09-16 05:35:49	<--	jsaa (~jsaa@134.134.137.73) has quit (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
2016-09-16 05:37:53	bnieuwenhuizen	on top of nir? Sounds painful, as CL has much less control flow restrictions.
2016-09-16 05:38:22	+anholt	would be nice to be able to represent my control flow in NIR.  but so far NIR control flow has scared me off.
2016-09-16 05:39:24	bnieuwenhuizen	CL supports preety much full goto functionality, and going from basic blocks to structured control flow is possible, but I don't think you want to do it without having an IR for the basic block based system
2016-09-16 05:40:09	+anholt	is it gotos based on all/any, or do you have to infer that from the cfg?
2016-09-16 05:40:52	bnieuwenhuizen	all/any? It is pretty much just C, and control flow is per invocation, so not SIMDized yet
2016-09-16 05:41:02	+anholt	ok, so have to work that out.

2016-09-16 11:04:09	nha	and src/mesa actually doesn't distinguish either ;)
2016-09-16 11:04:12	imirkin	ah doesn't look like it. ok. so then 64-bit is just somehow buggered.

2016-09-16 13:35:45	jekstrand	I'd also like to bring up blorp on gen4 and then delete all of meta from the GL driver
2016-09-16 13:36:09	jekstrand	And we need to add depth-stencil clear support to blorp (and use it in GL, because why not)
2016-09-16 13:36:14	jekstrand	I could keep going...
2016-09-16 13:37:03	jekstrand	Mostly, thought, my focus is on keeping up with Vulkan next stuff and taking the Vulkan driver from the somewhat shaky state it was at release to more solid, reliable, and featureful.

2016-09-22 15:01:18	imirkin_	well, the DX11 nvidia gpu's (fermi+) have a fused multiply-add op
2016-09-22 15:01:27	imirkin_	which performs the + on the unrounded result of x * y
2016-09-22 15:01:36	imirkin_	i.e. you get an extra bit of intermediate precision
2016-09-22 15:02:05	imirkin_	i believe some older AMD GPUs had both fused and unfused, not sure about newer ones
2016-09-22 15:02:05	bnieuwenhuizen	GCN has both MAD and FMA. we don't operate on vec3's anymore though, everything is scalar these days
2016-09-22 15:02:37	Prf_Jakob	bnieuwenhuizen: So 6 MAD/FMAs

2016-09-22 15:02:46	bnieuwenhuizen	IIRC there was a performance difference between the two on some generations, I don't remember which was which
2016-09-22 15:02:54	bnieuwenhuizen	Prf_Jakob: just 3?
2016-09-22 15:03:03	bnieuwenhuizen	componentwise
2016-09-22 15:03:09	Prf_Jakob	Oh right
2016-09-22 15:03:17	imirkin_	to be clear - MAD = a * b + c. FMA = fma(a, b, c)
2016-09-22 15:03:27	Prf_Jakob	the code is "return v * (2 * inv + 1) + inv;"
2016-09-22 15:03:55	imirkin_	although with GLSL rules, you are allowed to make a * b + c into a fma
2016-09-22 15:04:10	imirkin_	and you're allowed to ignore the extra precision implied by fma and make it into a * b + c.
2016-09-22 15:04:16	imirkin_	(yay for ARB_shader_precision)
2016-09-22 15:05:52	Prf_Jakob	Ah thanks
2016-09-22 15:06:12	imirkin_	also nvidia has some ops which take a "plus one" modifier :)
2016-09-22 15:06:45	Prf_Jakob	Hehe cool
2016-09-22 15:06:56	imirkin_	[but nouveau doesn't emit those]
2016-09-22 15:07:39	bnieuwenhuizen	why not? Limited instruction selection?
2016-09-22 15:07:52	imirkin_	laziness
2016-09-22 15:08:15	imirkin_	and my perception of it happening relatively rarely
2016-09-22 15:08:29	imirkin_	it's not like it's on EVERY op

2016-09-22 15:08:40	bnieuwenhuizen	apparently enough to implement it in hardware
2016-09-22 15:08:55	imirkin_	they had a spare bit :)
2016-09-22 15:09:13	imirkin_	my guess actually is that it's for 1 - a - b
2016-09-22 15:09:26	bnieuwenhuizen	do you have neg modifiers?
2016-09-22 15:09:30	imirkin_	yes
2016-09-22 15:09:39	imirkin_	but if you set both of them on an FADD, that's what you get
2016-09-22 15:09:50	imirkin_	i.e. the "plus one" modifier is the same as setting both neg modifiers
2016-09-22 15:10:01	imirkin_	(iow, you can't really set both neg modifiers at once)
2016-09-22 15:10:39	bnieuwenhuizen	only for ALU or also for texturing/memory access?
2016-09-22 15:10:47	imirkin_	those don't have modifiers
2016-09-22 15:11:08	imirkin_	diff instructions get totally different modifiers
2016-09-22 15:11:51	bnieuwenhuizen	for GCN we support abs and neg on sources, and * (0.5, 1, 2, 4) and clamp to [-1, 1] on dst
2016-09-22 15:12:55	bnieuwenhuizen	though modifiers and immediates (except a happy few) don't mesh well, as we only allow those immediates on 32-bit insn formats, while most modifiers are on the 64-bit format
2016-09-22 15:13:24	imirkin_	yeah, we generally support that stuff

2016-09-22 18:28:28	Kayden	imirkin: I looked at dcbaker's patches, and noticed that the old list was sorted case-insensitively, and the new one was sorted case-sensitively, causing lots of changes
2016-09-22 18:28:42	imirkin_	i noticed that as well
2016-09-22 18:28:42	Kayden	imirkin: so I asked him to redo that to be insensitive, and the new patch is much smaller - it's like 2-3 lines :)
2016-09-22 18:28:45	imirkin_	but chose not to comment about it
2016-09-22 18:29:02	Kayden	I looked at all three, and they look good to me too
2016-09-22 18:29:03	imirkin_	LC settings affect it
2016-09-22 18:29:17	Kayden	does it seem reasonable to push them now?

2016-09-22 18:29:33	imirkin_	it seemed reasonable to push them before, so i don't see why now would be different :)
2016-09-22 18:30:03	Kayden	cool.  I wasn't sure if we should wait for somebody else, but with two of us looking at it...eh
2016-09-22 18:30:07	Kayden	may as well just go for it
2016-09-22 18:30:18	imirkin_	well, it only really matters at release time

2016-09-22 18:30:24	Kayden	true
2016-09-22 18:30:36	imirkin_	in case someone really hates it, they can yell loudly, and we can revert the last patch
2016-09-22 18:30:40	Kayden	dcbaker: alright, use your newfound commit powers :)
2016-09-22 18:30:44	dcbaker	whoo
2016-09-22 18:31:08	imirkin_	it's not like a release is happening tomorrow, and i think changing ABI of non-released things is open-game
2016-09-22 18:32:05	imirkin_	i really should get off my lazy ass and finish up ARB_enhanced_layouts for gallium...
2016-09-22 18:32:21	imirkin_	but ... it's so lazy ...
2016-09-22 18:32:32	Kayden	would be cool :)
2016-09-22 18:32:39	Kayden	but also...oh so annoying to work on.
2016-09-22 18:32:47	imirkin_	well - the majority of it is simple
2016-09-22 18:32:53	imirkin_	i just have to ... redo inputs and outputs
2016-09-22 18:32:56	imirkin_	how hard can that be :)
2016-09-22 18:33:08	Kayden	about 6 months of pain :)
2016-09-22 18:33:20	imirkin_	well, the "hard" bits are actually easy in this case
2016-09-22 18:33:35	imirkin_	it's just that inputs/outputs are passed in in an inconvenient fashion, and i have to redo that
2016-09-22 18:33:54	imirkin_	since they're passed in on a slot-by-slot basis
2016-09-22 18:34:08	imirkin_	but that breaks down with potentially overlapping indirectly-accessed arrays
2016-09-22 18:34:55	imirkin_	so now i have to come up with a datastructure that'll handle it all. and invariably i'll get it wrong. repeat. hence the lazy approach
2016-09-22 18:35:29	imirkin_	and there's no fire under my ass to get it done since it's not like any games require it (that i'm aware of)
2016-09-22 18:36:07	imirkin_	and there are increasing numbers of users for whom nouveau totally breaks down with the increased concurrent GL usage... =/
2016-09-22 18:36:49	imirkin_	[and i'm waffling back and forth on what the best way to resolve it is, since i basically hate all the options]

2016-09-22 18:43:36	imirkin_	unfortunately libdrm_nouveau can decide to do a kick pretty much whenever the fuck it feels like
2016-09-22 18:43:44	imirkin_	and we have a callback thing which does stuff

2016-09-22 20:24:21	dcbaker	imirkin: I'm not sure how much I'm going to be doing, but I'm kinda winding down piglit work so I'm looking at other things that need doing
2016-09-22 20:24:58	imirkin	ah ok, cool
2016-09-22 20:26:52	dcbaker	I have been meaning to go cleanup up a bunch of the stuff in mapi/glapi/gen

2016-09-22 20:28:16	imirkin	that'd be awesome
2016-09-22 20:28:48	imirkin	there's also get_hash_params.py and associated logic - not the python per se, but the actual underlying mechanisms suck for developers
2016-09-22 20:29:16	imirkin	i have some ideas... hit me up if you'd be interested in tackling it
2016-09-22 20:29:28	imirkin	[ideas re get.c & co, that is]
2016-09-22 20:31:59	imirkin	although that'll mostly be C work, not Python work. i guess you prefer to stay in Python-land
2016-09-22 20:33:59	dcbaker	I know I should expand my horizons beyond Python, but I'm having trouble motivating myself, lol

2016-09-23 06:22:54	robclark	chadv, right, that is the other extension (which is already part of my patchset)..
2016-09-23 06:23:03	chadv	oh. i don't believe EGL_ANDROID_wait_sync exists. i've never seen that one.
2016-09-23 06:23:23	robclark	but according to https://source.android.com/devices/graphics/implement-vsync.html _wait_sync must also be implemented..
2016-09-23 06:23:43	robclark	hmm..
2016-09-23 06:23:45	robclark	"EGL_ANDROID_wait_sync. Allows GPU-side stalls rather than in CPU, making the GPU wait for an EGLSyncKHR. This is essentially the same as the EGL_KHR_wait_sync extension (refer to that specification for details)."
2016-09-23 06:24:20	chadv	I suspect it existed in AOSP long ago, before the real wait_sync extension became KHR-ified.
2016-09-23 06:24:39	robclark	hmm, possibly.. seems like maybe we just need to add extension string, I guess..

2016-09-23 14:37:39	Kayden	dcbaker: it might make sense to revert your patch and fix scons, then we can retry once idr and folks are back and people have an idea what to do about it.
2016-09-23 14:38:02	dcbaker	Well, it's litterally two functions that don't work
2016-09-23 14:38:03	imirkin_	scons appears to just be missing a dep
2016-09-23 14:38:08	imirkin_	or am i wrong?
2016-09-23 14:38:10	Kayden	ah
2016-09-23 14:38:13	dcbaker	I'm not sure
2016-09-23 14:38:19	dcbaker	BlendBarrier breaks it
2016-09-23 14:38:20	imirkin_	i assume it's just not regenerating that file
2016-09-23 14:38:28	imirkin_	but i didn't look carefully
2016-09-23 14:38:39	imirkin_	generally the vmware folk fix the scons-related issues
2016-09-23 14:38:42	dcbaker	and PrimitiveBoundingBox
2016-09-23 14:38:52	Kayden	I wonder if it broke for the barrier.c rename or something.
2016-09-23 14:39:18	dcbaker	I'm thinking that since scons only builds bless and BlendBarrier only exists in GLES (the KHR variant exists in GL) that's the problem there
2016-09-23 14:39:35	dcbaker	s/bless/OpenGL
2016-09-23 14:39:47	dcbaker	and the same with PrimitiveBoundingBox
2016-09-23 14:39:59	imirkin_	i think you can run scons on linux, but i'm not sure how
2016-09-23 14:40:05	imirkin_	might be as easy as just 'scons'
2016-09-23 14:40:09	dcbaker	yup
2016-09-23 14:40:13	dcbaker	that's how I got to that point
2016-09-23 14:40:26	imirkin_	ah ok
2016-09-23 14:40:30	dcbaker	commenting out BlendBarrier and PrimitiveBoundingBox in static_data.py makes it work on linux at least
2016-09-23 14:40:33	imirkin_	you're 5 steps ahead of me. nevermind.
2016-09-23 14:40:44	dcbaker	well, I'm kinda at a wall right now

2016-09-23 14:41:00	imirkin_	good. that means i can avoid hitting it ;)
2016-09-23 14:41:05	dcbaker	lol
2016-09-23 14:42:05	dcbaker	I think because those two functions exist only in GLES and scons doesn't build it it doesn't have gles32.h and that's the problem
2016-09-23 14:42:08	dcbaker	I think
2016-09-23 14:43:03	dcbaker	Looking at the python scripts they're not really right, because they statically expose all of the symbols in static_data.functions in both GL.so and libGLES*.so
2016-09-23 14:43:06	dcbaker	which seems wrong
2016-09-23 14:43:27	imirkin_	well, they exist as BlendBarrierKHR and PrimitiveBoundingBoxARB
2016-09-23 14:43:31	imirkin_	which are aliased to those
2016-09-23 14:43:49	imirkin_	yeah, i think that's something we're aware of
2016-09-23 14:43:53	imirkin_	and have kinda gone 'meh' at
2016-09-23 14:44:09	dcbaker	does gallium implement either of those? At least one looked like only i965 supported it (BlendBarrier I think)
2016-09-23 14:44:39	dcbaker	according to features.txt anyway
2016-09-23 14:44:42	imirkin_	PrimitiveBoundingBox is a sw-only impl, basically
2016-09-23 14:44:47	imirkin_	BlendBarrier is i965-only for now
2016-09-23 14:45:09	imirkin_	not for any real reason other than 'laziness'
2016-09-23 14:45:17	dcbaker	but gallium does have PrmitiveBoundBox?
2016-09-23 14:45:25	imirkin_	heh
2016-09-23 14:45:31	dcbaker	lol
2016-09-23 14:45:36	imirkin_	i'm not sure what you mean by 'has'
2016-09-23 14:46:12	imirkin_	glPrimitiveBoundingBox is available as part of ES 3.2, and no gallium driver advertises ES 3.2
2016-09-23 14:46:22	dcbaker	okay
2016-09-23 14:46:42	dcbaker	does one of the gallium drivers have a ARB/OES/EXT variant?
2016-09-23 14:46:47	imirkin_	there's glPrimitiveBoundingBoxOES (OES_primitive_bounding_box) and glPrimitiveBoundingBoxEXT (EXT_primitive_bounding_box) and glPrimitiveBoundingBoxARB (ARB_ES3_2_compatibility)
2016-09-23 14:46:53	imirkin_	but none of those are glPrimitiveBoundingBox.
2016-09-23 14:47:03	dcbaker	but we alias them, right?
2016-09-23 14:47:07	imirkin_	sure.
2016-09-23 14:47:16	imirkin_	but having the function there has nothing to do with exposing the ext
2016-09-23 14:47:30	imirkin_	[ok, i mean, they're a _little_ related, but not nearly as connected as you might perhaps think]
2016-09-23 14:48:00	imirkin_	e.g. if you end up with a nouveau_vieux build (that's ancient nvidia stuff), it'll still have entry points for all the fancy new extensions
2016-09-23 14:48:11	imirkin_	they'll all just end up setting GL_INVALID_OPERATION
2016-09-23 14:48:25	dcbaker	I guess I'm just trying to reason whether someone has an optimization somewhere that removes functions with no support and since scons only builds llvmpipe and the vmware driver stuff they don't support is getting removed
2016-09-23 14:48:39	imirkin_	unlikely.
2016-09-23 14:48:48	dcbaker	that's the feeling I'm getting
2016-09-23 14:48:53	imirkin_	remember - the dri driver is hidden behind ... the dri driver interface
2016-09-23 14:48:58	dcbaker	right
2016-09-23 14:49:19	dcbaker	okay, so it still could be a problem with not building libGLES* though, right?
2016-09-23 14:49:29	imirkin_	yes.
2016-09-23 14:52:10	Kayden	I'm wondering if bbox.h and barrier.h need to be mentioned somewhere.
2016-09-23 14:52:17	Kayden	those are new-ish files
2016-09-23 14:52:24	imirkin_	they should be in Makefile.sources

2016-09-23 14:58:33	imirkin_	airlied has a branch
2016-09-23 14:58:37	Kayden	dcbaker, imirkin_: OK, so...it's not discovering glPrimitiveBoundingBox itself...I'm guessing this is because those don't exist in include/GL/*.h, but only in the GLES includes.  this might be the first time ES has a un-suffixed name which GL doesn't have.
2016-09-23 14:59:03	imirkin_	Kayden: makes sense.
2016-09-23 14:59:05	dcbaker	yeah, that's kinda what I was thinking
2016-09-23 14:59:42	Kayden	I'm not sure what to do about it.  I'd be inclined to revert and have Emil or Ian or someone figure out the right thing to do
2016-09-23 15:00:04	Kayden	though...it sounds like the autotools build must be including GLES includes somehow..
2016-09-23 15:00:51	dcbaker	autotools turns on gles autmatically doesn't it?
2016-09-23 15:01:01	imirkin_	there are enables for it

2016-09-23 15:18:10	Kayden	fair :)
2016-09-23 15:21:06	dcbaker	I'm not sure, I don't think it'll be that hard to modify the python layer to store static entry points separately for GL, gles1, and gles2+
2016-09-23 15:21:41	Kayden	honestly I think it's probably just a bug
2016-09-23 15:21:56	Kayden	the static_functions list is just supposed to be a list of which symbols to expose
2016-09-23 15:22:12	Kayden	but those functions don't exist, and should have gotten removed by the API checks
2016-09-23 15:22:23	Kayden	so we shouldn't even be trying to generate them..

2016-09-23 15:29:20	+anholt	I can sleep(1) and a "print(open(self.test_results_file, 'r').read())" gives me truncated results

2016-09-23 15:29:53	+anholt	no, wait.  that's the second test I'm seeing for the "fine" case
2016-09-23 15:32:41	dcbaker	so print() is working fine but cat isn't?
2016-09-23 15:33:07	+anholt	print() shows me truncated results (same as end up going through the piglit pipeline)
2016-09-23 15:33:10	+anholt	catting the file after is fine

2016-09-23 15:34:13	dcbaker	okay
2016-09-23 15:34:29	+anholt	still trying to run cat into stdout right before I try my reread print()
2016-09-23 15:35:39	imirkin_	anholt: is test_results_file a real file or is it a pipe?
2016-09-23 15:35:46	+anholt	real file
2016-09-23 15:36:01	+anholt	(it sticks around after the tests are done if I drop the remove())
2016-09-23 15:36:18	dcbaker	yeah, it should be a real file created by xts
2016-09-23 15:36:25	dcbaker	we're not managing it
2016-09-23 15:36:39	dcbaker	I wonder if cat syncs before reading and python's file.read doesn't?
2016-09-23 15:37:01	+anholt	python should be synced with the test having exited and written its data
2016-09-23 15:37:16	+anholt	we won't interpret_result() before the process is done, will we?
2016-09-23 15:37:26	dcbaker	no we don't, the process is closed
2016-09-23 15:37:51	dcbaker	we don't get the stdout and stderr until after it finishes
2016-09-23 15:37:52	+anholt	looks like cat at that point is truncated output, too.
2016-09-23 15:38:47	+anholt	hmm.  putting in a subprocess.call("ps wuax | grep XCopyArea", shell=True) shows the process in Ss state.
