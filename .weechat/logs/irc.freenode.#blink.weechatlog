2016-07-29 14:43:53	jvilk	Hey all! I have a question about JavaScript events in blink. Is there an event queue for JS events? I found base::MessageLoop, and noticed that DOMTimers are posted through there as PendingTasks, but I had trouble discerning through the source if other events (e.g. XHR progress events) are also enqueued through there.

2016-07-29 14:47:44	jvilk	If there isn't, then I suppose something has to be enforcing the constraint that only one JS event executes at once; any pointers as to what that may be would be appreciated.

2016-07-29 15:09:49	reillyeon	jvilk, I'm not familiar with the specific path through which JS events get posted to a base::MessageLoop but the constraint enforcing them to not be executed in parallel is simply that there's only one thread pulling tasks out of that queue.
2016-07-29 15:10:49	jvilk	reillyeon: yeah, that's what I thought. There are a lot of queues in Chrome, though, so I'm looking for whichever one handles JS events in the main context.
2016-07-29 15:12:24	jvilk	I think I'm close to finding it; looks like there's a WebTaskRunner that MainThreadTaskRunner posts tasks to.

2016-09-14 13:32:36	+thakis	can anyone here give me the 2-minute explanation what the point of StyleColor::resolve() and its "current color" concept are? eae maybe?
2016-09-14 13:39:28	jbroman	the initial value of border-color is the value of color
2016-09-14 13:39:49	jbroman	CSS3 also adds currentColor keyword that means this
2016-09-14 13:40:12	jbroman	i.e. <div style="border:1px solid; color:red"> will have a red border
2016-09-14 13:40:44	jbroman	(this is true even if the value of color is inherited)
2016-09-14 13:43:23	jbroman	e.g. <body style="color:green"><div style="border:10px solid"> will draw a green border
2016-09-14 13:44:33	+thakis	jbroman, so https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/core/style/StyleRareInheritedData.h?cl=GROK&rcl=1473852388&l=82 calls  m_textFillColor = color.resolve(Color())
2016-09-14 13:44:43	+thakis	what does resolving against a default Color() mean?
2016-09-14 13:45:14	+thakis	the default text fill color is transparent?

2016-09-14 13:47:25	jbroman	thakis: it's irrelevant what color is used there
2016-09-14 13:47:26	jbroman	see the getter
2016-09-14 13:47:34	jbroman	in that case m_textFillColorIsCurrentColor will be true
2016-09-14 13:47:44	jbroman	and textFillColor() will return Stylecolor::currentColor()
2016-09-14 13:47:58	+thakis	aah
2016-09-14 13:48:25	+thakis	why doesn't it do m_textFillColor = color then?
2016-09-14 13:48:43	jbroman	m_textFillColor is a blink::Color
2016-09-14 13:48:47	jbroman	color is a blink::StyleColor
2016-09-14 13:48:56	+thakis	ah
2016-09-14 13:49:02	jbroman	it's just storing the two fields of blink::StyleColor
2016-09-14 13:49:20	jbroman	for memory packing reasons, it's stored in StyleRareInheritedData separately
2016-09-14 13:49:28	+thakis	got it, thanks

2016-09-23 17:15:47	gcasto_sheriff	I'm trying to track down a flaky test (https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=649589), and I'm having issues actually running the test.
2016-09-23 17:16:54	gcasto_sheriff	According to https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/webkit-layout-tests, it seems like doing "python third_party/WebKit/Tools/Scripts/run-webkit-tests -t Default virtual/" would run this particular test ("virtual/gpu-rasteriziation/fast/forms/..."), but it doesn't.
2016-09-23 17:17:14	gcasto_sheriff	Is there a special incantation that I'm missing out on?
2016-09-23 17:19:41	+dpranke	gcasto_sherrif: the virtual tests are weird
2016-09-23 17:19:46	+dpranke	and so, yeah, that doesn't quite work
2016-09-23 17:19:49	+dpranke	one sec, ...
2016-09-23 17:23:05	+dpranke	gcasto: you should be able to run virtual/gpu-rasterization/fast/images/color-profile-background-clip-text.html (i.e., list the test itself)
2016-09-23 17:23:05	+dpranke	 
2016-09-23 17:23:15	+dpranke	or just virtual/gpu-rasterization/fast/images
2016-09-23 17:27:23	gcasto_sheriff	Interesting. But substrings don't work like other layout tests? I specifically tried virtual/gpu-rasterization/ and that didn't do anything.
2016-09-23 17:27:32	gcasto_sheriff	That's kinda weird.
2016-09-23 17:27:50	gcasto_sheriff	That does work though
2016-09-23 17:27:54	gcasto_sheriff	Thanks for the advice
2016-09-23 17:27:57	+dpranke	yes, it's weird. the problem is that most of the tests in the virtual directory don't really exist
2016-09-23 17:28:09	+dpranke	but sometimes there are real files checked in
2016-09-23 17:28:32	+dpranke	and so when discovering tests the logic is tricky. It can probably be improved, but hasn't been a big problem most of the time.
2016-09-23 17:29:10	+dpranke	I'm guessing you don't really care about any more detail, but it might not be a bad idea to file a bug and get someone to fix it, now that we have people working on that test harness again.

2016-09-24 11:51:44	randallb	hey there, qq... it seems that chrome / blink doesn't support the `sinkId` property for constructing an audio context, but does support setting sink IDs for audio and video elements... is this accurate? Haven't been able to confirm this in mailing list discussion or in the bug tracker. (cc cwilso)
