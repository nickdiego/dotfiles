2016-07-27 16:27:48	Llewelyn	randomA: The funny thing about CPU voltage is that it can drift based on a number of factors like dynamic clock speed and heat. This is why it is advisable to check for motherboard firmware updates as that is where most of those tables live and if there is an error for your CPU it can cause an issue. Of course on intel systems the firmware also contains microcode that can be outdated and lead to even more issues.

2016-07-27 16:36:54	Llewelyn	randomA: volts are a measure of electric force. amperes measure a quantity of electrons and a watt is the SI unit to measure /power/ which corresponds to the potential difference between one volt and the current one ampere.

2016-07-27 16:37:29	BrainDamage	not a quantity of electrons, a flux of charge

2016-07-27 16:38:59	Llewelyn	randomA: The voltate used by the system and especially your CPU, memory and GPU changes constantly as the resistance of the circuits is not static and it needs to rise and fall to meet those demands.

2016-07-29 06:17:26	alad	willeponken: because it adds maintenance cost
2016-07-29 06:17:42	Earnestly	willeponken: Easier to just supply upstream software as-is

2016-07-29 06:18:06	Earnestly	I personally prefer this because Arch makes doing development/exploration the best choice since there's not much extra you have to do

2016-07-29 06:20:49	xn0r	maintenance cost could be kept to a minimum if the package format was better, and the bulk work would actually be the initial effort to create lean and clean packages instead of monolithic monsters that pull in everything

2016-07-29 06:32:50	willeponken	well, i mean, the package sizes isn't that bad - just a default build of nginx vs. the arch build is much larger (the binary)

2016-07-29 06:38:39	willeponken	is arch builds really just using what upstream provides by default? as i said before with nginx, the pkgbuild provides flags
2016-07-29 06:38:44	demize	I mean, the repos would fit on a bluray disk, which weighs rather little.

2016-07-29 06:57:07	dandels	To me at least Arch's point seems to be about making it simple _for the distro maintainers_, which for the end user means the distro isn't a mess of backwards compatiblity and hacks. Package splitting is antithetical to this. If you want it you can do it yourself with the toolchain that's given to you, and this is a good thing. If you go about changing this, it's not something that's "Arch" in the simplicity sense.

2016-07-29 07:03:39	TheTeapot	So, for the boot partition, should it be an ext2 filesystem and mounted to /boot when I go to run grub_install?

2016-07-29 07:04:20	dandels	I don't know if the fs matters. Grub manages just fine on ext4 in my / partition.
2016-07-29 07:04:21	Earnestly	TheTeapot: There's no reason to use ext2, and modern kernels have the option to not even provide ext2.ko, it's all ext4 with different options
2016-07-29 07:04:43	Earnestly	TheTeapot: So use a proper filesystem that has some journaling or protective measures

2016-07-29 07:09:39	TheTeapot	Earnestly: So, if I make it ext4; then I have it mounted at /boot before grub_install?

2016-07-29 07:10:32	dandels	TheTeapot, it's actually just a simple paste. I've an alias in my bashrc for piping directly to ptpb, "alias pastebin='curl -F c=@- https://ptpb.pw/'" and then I can "lsblk -f|pastebin"

2016-07-29 11:31:12	fpqc	lacrymology, i believe if you use lvm it should be easy to set up your swap bc you just mark the volume contiguous and you can grow it later.. I think
2016-07-29 11:31:22	fpqc	and it will move stuff around for you to allow it to grow or shrink
2016-07-29 11:31:22	ChrisWarrick	lacrymology: I’d try to avoid that. Especially because Windows can modify your partition layout.
2016-07-29 11:31:24	delusionallogic	It was like pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring
2016-07-29 11:31:40	fpqc	lacrymology, also lvm will protect your partition layout from windows
2016-07-29 11:31:53	fpqc	also a suggestion on windows
2016-07-29 11:31:57	lacrymology	fpqc: what's lvm? virtual machine?

2016-07-29 11:32:11	@grawity	Windows isn't going to touch your non-Windows partitions one way or another
2016-07-29 11:32:19	fpqc	grawity, it will write to ESP
2016-07-29 11:32:29	tuelz	just curious if any of you have some suggestions on my current situation...I've got an old app running on a super old 2.2 linux kernel running a 0.10 couchdb server I'm wanting to migrate to another hosting provider, problem is host (linode) doesn't provide earlier than 4.x kernels and couchdb dependencies won't compile on new kernels I also can't upgrade couchdb because api changed at 1.0 - I may be stuck
2016-07-29 11:32:29	delusionallogic	Except for the bootloader
2016-07-29 11:32:31	tuelz	where I'm at, but I'm playing with some ideas like trying to find a docker env for couchdb that I can use to move it over
2016-07-29 11:32:34	@grawity	fpqc: so what? it won't delete your GRUB
2016-07-29 11:32:40	@grawity	and it's not like you can put the ESP on lvm

I am trying now to manually download package from git, read the code and use makepkg -is to install it. Since this is a very slow process (but most secure), why isn't good practice to use some more reliable helper e.g. pacaur? Can't I also check the code before I install some package using pacaur?

2016-07-29 13:02:46	fpqc	UEFI is designed to remove the need for an intermediate bootloader such as GRUB. If your motherboard has a good UEFI implementation, it is possible to embed the kernel parameters within a UEFI boot entry and for the motherboard to boot Arch directly. You can use efibootmgr or UEFI Shell v2 to modify your motherboard's boot entries.

2016-07-29 13:05:06	@grawity	and given that Linux occassionally breaks and that one occassionally needs to boot into rescue mode, that's a critical feature missing from the firmware's built-in boot manager

2016-09-14 11:42:16	stardancer	this isnt a basic distro
2016-09-14 11:42:23	NicoHood	grawity: I've read the freedesktop page, but doesnt this just add another user who has global access? but does this user then automatically start a pulse daemon?
2016-09-14 11:42:23	stardancer	oh, actually, it's so basic it's not
2016-09-14 11:42:40	stardancer	it's so basic that people relying on android apps to install it are in the deep end of the wrong pool
2016-09-14 11:42:52	stardancer	good ol' dd never fails
2016-09-14 11:43:09	Tom^	well it does when the iso isnt setup to work with dd
2016-09-14 11:43:11	d1z	macgyver: so it's best to be left at that? Thing is I'm experiencing a lot of packet loss in games during the day (terribly congested isp), and I'm wondering whether changing the mtu to a higher value change anything (as less packets would be sent, decreasing the probability of loss)
2016-09-14 11:43:15	GodGinrai	Yes, but most people learn these things by experiencing Arch.  If you suggest they aren't "qualified" to be in the channel based on what they are capable of, you drastically reduce the number of new users.

2016-09-14 13:57:40	Retr0id	modprobe: FATAL: Module msr not found in directory /lib/modules/4.7.2-1-ck
2016-09-14 13:57:51	Retr0id	Of course, a reboot will fix it
2016-09-14 13:58:11	Retr0id	but is there a way to "flush" the old kernel version from whatever is caching it?

2016-09-14 13:58:22	grawity	it's not a cache, and there's nothing you can flush.
2016-09-14 13:58:36	grawity	it uses that kernel version *because you are currently running that kernel*

2016-09-14 16:32:01	Earnestly	DANtheBEASTman: Yes, and you can do that with just a single pacmd instance, without registering a new pa client every second
2016-09-14 16:32:10	blackslab	But I can't boot. Stuck at grub loading.
2016-09-14 16:32:11	Earnestly	DANtheBEASTman: It's kind of involved, I'd suggest just using alsa
2016-09-14 16:32:22	Earnestly	DANtheBEASTman: That is, getting the master volume from alsa while using pa
2016-09-14 16:32:27	Earnestly	Since tools already exist for that

2016-09-14 20:47:51	sheep	is that a user unit or a system unit?
2016-09-14 20:48:06	victoroux	user, i made it myself
2016-09-14 20:48:14	victoroux	shall i share those as well?
2016-09-14 20:48:14	sheep	no, it's system.
2016-09-14 20:48:34	victoroux	oh, i'm new to systemd -- i figured since i wrote it it'd be user
2016-09-14 20:48:38	sheep	/etc/systemd/system has system units. you want to put it in a user directory
2016-09-14 20:48:53	victoroux	well i figured anyone on the system can use this unit, so i put it in the former
2016-09-14 20:49:00	sheep	also, does this need access to an X server? if so, you need to export the DISPLAY environment variable for it
2016-09-14 20:49:01	victoroux	but since it is my user name in ther,e i'll move it haha
2016-09-14 20:49:19	sheep	you could make it a user unit and it would still be available to all users
2016-09-14 20:49:35	sheep	but it should run per-user rather than system-wide
2016-09-14 20:49:41	victoroux	oh i see
2016-09-14 20:49:51	sheep	what does this service do?
2016-09-14 20:50:22	victoroux	it reads a file that has xprintidle in it, if it's over 30s it tells another script to turn off the display
2016-09-14 20:50:30	victoroux	the script itself shouldn't require x server, right?
2016-09-14 20:50:35	victoroux	if it's calling other scripts
2016-09-14 20:50:38	victoroux	idk..
2016-09-14 20:50:48	sheep	how does the other script turn off the display?
2016-09-14 20:50:54	victoroux	xset s activate
2016-09-14 20:50:59	sheep	that needs X
2016-09-14 20:51:04	victoroux	yea, the child script does
2016-09-14 20:51:16	sheep	so the entire thing does.

2016-09-14 20:51:34	sheep	something has to pass the DISPLAY variable to the child, or it has to have some way to determine it
2016-09-14 20:51:49	RudyValencia	blackslab, alyptik: AD-synced users don't get a DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS, XDG_RUNTIME_DIR or XDG_SESSION_ID and these seem to be what keeps AD users from signing in
2016-09-14 20:52:01	sheep	it might make more sense to start the script in the background from your ~/.xinitrc or ~/.xprofile since it needs X context to run
2016-09-14 20:52:01	victoroux	i've added DISPLAY and XAUTHORITY environment variables and it's the same message
2016-09-14 20:52:11	sheep	how did you add them>

2016-09-14 20:53:22	victoroux	so the way this script works, it sets the soft display off, and runs another script in the background stopping this service while that runs

2016-09-15 06:58:12	mSSM	Wasn't there something like a best-practices PKGBUILD for various languages? Say I want to make a PKGBUILD which supports python3 and python2; I frequently see “makedepends=('python', 'python-setuptools', 'python2', 'python2-setuptools'), together with a build() and package_...() for both versions. But doesn't this mean that when I set the makedepends of the python2-PKG to python3?

2016-09-15 13:10:31	Exagone313	Hi, sometimes when I shutdown my computer, running lightdm + i3, it waits for a 1 min 30s job to stop the session, is there a keyboard action possible to terminate it? tried ctrl +c, esc, alt sys q/r... I found nothing. Or, to stop this happen. Thanks for your help.

2016-09-15 13:11:10	schaeferpp	hey guys. since a couple of weeks my display stays black after it poweres off because i didnt touch my notebook even after typing letters on the keyboard. only switching to TTY and then back to X (ctrl+alt+f2) helps and re-enables my display. I'm using gdm and gnome-shell at the latest repo-versions. do you have any idea of what I can search for to determine what's wrong?

I already cleaned all the stuff, just wondering if I my have acquired some more unrelated circular deps during my system lifetime.

I am currently using xfce4-power-manager, but it seems to break when I use my screen locker (physlock). I don't want to debug that, I'd like to find other methods of suspending the system when it is idle for a certain amount of time.

2016-09-15 14:32:29	teraflops	well this weekend I'll take a deeper look and decide what to do
2016-09-15 14:32:39	OlaRune	hello, after doing a pacman -Suy which upgraded the kernel i got problems booting, i'm using systemd-boot, i got an error saying that the root fs couldn't be mounted because it couldn't find the specified partuuid, after googling many users seems to have had this problem during the years, i solved it by booting with the arch cd, mounting the fs, chrooting and doing mkinitcpio -p linux
2016-09-15 14:32:47	xogium	teraflops: could maybe run chromium in docker
2016-09-15 14:32:51	OlaRune	can anyone explain what went wrong when upgrading and why mkinitcpio solved it?

2016-09-16 00:29:29	cisco87	Hi, I was wondering if you some of you could help me. I have a problem with the kernel update to the 4.7.3-2, I install it and linux-headers, but my system seem to keep booting always the 4.7.2 version, seems that /boot/vmlinuz-linux is still the 4.7.2

2016-09-16 01:21:37	ninjai	ok cisco87 that worked.  So what the hell happened in the first place so that if my kernel upgrades it's not all broken again?

2016-09-16 01:23:15	cisco87	it happened that you have your /boot which is in your root filesystem, when you install `linux` you update the kernel image to /boot/vmlinuz-linux, but your bootloader is referring to an image you have now in /boot/efi/vmlinuz-linux
2016-09-16 01:24:00	cisco87	if you move /boot to /boot.old , recreate an empty /boot dir, then mount /dev/sdc1 to /boot and re-upgrade the kernel, you should be ok

2016-09-16 03:56:47	MrElendig	not that it will make any difference on your system except maybe 30MiB of saved disk space

2016-09-16 05:04:01	anigma_	Howdy! I'm fairly new to the arch way, and I've been following the install guide on the wiki. However, I can never seem to boot the system afterwards. GRUB just freezes.. I suspect there could be something wrong with my partition scheme. I do it manually with gdisk on a BIOS enabled vm in vbox. I currently have a 200M BIOS boot, 1G SWAP, 4G / and 5G /home - that would suffice, yes? 
2016-09-16 05:04:07	TheAnachron	Boohbah: welcome :)

2016-09-16 14:27:11	MrNeon	Gaffel, the routers answers to DNS but I'm using Google's DNS with "server=8.8.8.8" on dnsmasq.conf, I thought that "server=//192.168.1.1" would redirect dotless domains to the router.
2016-09-16 14:27:28	MacGyver	It should.
2016-09-16 14:27:40	Gaffel	If your router responds, use it as your DNS
2016-09-16 14:27:55	Gaffel	If your router can't resolve it, it will forward the lookup.
2016-09-16 14:28:14	MrNeon	It will answer to some domains with a legal notice.
2016-09-16 14:28:24	MacGyver	Gaffel: Except forwarding the lookup is exactly what he doesn't want to do because the router will forward to the ISP's DNS server, not Google's.
2016-09-16 14:28:27	sypher	MrNeon: You have a fundamental misunderstanding of how DNS works. You need to pass a DNS domain/DNS suffix to your clients through DHCP, and use the router for ALL DNS lookups. Configure the router to forward to your desired DNS host.
2016-09-16 14:28:41	MacGyver	MrNeon: I take it the router isn't configurable to ignore your ISP's DHCP-provided DNS server?
2016-09-16 14:28:54	MacGyver	sypher: No, he does not.
2016-09-16 14:28:55	Gaffel	Can't you specify forwarderes manually in your router?
2016-09-16 14:28:58	MrNeon	It's an ISP router, I can't touch anything pretty much.
2016-09-16 14:29:19	Gaffel	I see
2016-09-16 14:29:36	MacGyver	He's configuring the *local* resolver to distinguish between qualified domainnames and local names. Local names go to server A, qualified names to server B.
2016-09-16 14:29:46	grazzolini	MrNeon: why not skip your router altogether?
2016-09-16 14:29:51	MacGyver	This should work fine, and usually does, and is supported by dnsmasq.
2016-09-16 14:30:05	Gaffel	So, a local DNS on the machine that splits the resolving into stub zones.
2016-09-16 14:30:06	MacGyver	grazzolini: Local DHCP-based DNS lookups a la dyndns.

LatGrkCyr renders beautifully on my screen, but i have a problem with text input. it will not show the right glyphs when toggling to gr. i 've tried varioua unimaps, greek dos cp737 stuff, iso7 (the natural choice?). in general  experimentation has led to no cure for greek input and in fact ruined text output as well...

2016-09-16 18:05:11	DarkFeather	Boohbah: it downgrades, as shown in the paste. I ran pacman -U <opensmtpd tar>. That version is ahead of mirrors. I want to be able to run some operation in pacman that will not touch packages ahead of the mirror and only touch those behind. You're telling me that's not possible. Understood.

2016-09-16 18:06:26	eris	DarkFeather: You fucking told pacman to install the newest version of the package, that's the polar fucking oposite of "running some operation in pacman that will not touch packages ahead of the mirror".

2016-09-22 20:12:47	Scimmia	startxfce4 is the only one I know of that can be called directly and will start X for you
2016-09-22 20:13:06	Scimmia	still good practice to use xinit/startx, though

2016-09-22 21:30:22	MacGyver	Well, so the thing is, BIOS-based machines don't always like it when you try to boot GPT-disks, and UEFI-based machines don't always like it when you try to boot MBR-disks. I don't know how vmware fusion handles either, but the safe bets are BIOS/MBR and UEFI/GPT.
2016-09-22 21:30:42	MacGyver	So the next question is: why GPT, and is the machine-type UEFI then?

2016-09-22 22:02:46	KKKrx	MacGyver: yeah, I'm looking for one that has a GUI

I got advice that it might be a kernel issue but a VM on my mac mini resumes perfectly from suspend. I am running the latest kernel. Its an HP Probook 450 G3 with Intel HD + AMD Radeon. When it freezes i cant ssh nor i can switch ttys. Any ideas?

I wish my OS was all in English language but my keyboard Portuguese. when I set /etc/locale.conf , uncomment en_US....  so i configured for English and ran locale-gen. It was generated English language. Perfect. but when I set the keyboard to Portuguese in /etc/vconsole.conf with KEYMAP=br-abnt2 the Ç does not work. system says error to set the keyboard. I suspe
2016-09-23 16:27:32	BadPixel	ct it is because of the locale-gen that do not have Portuguese as well. right?

2016-09-23 17:36:33	grazzolini	Lowl3v3l: de fact standard behavior is to specify which python you're using

2016-09-23 17:37:33	teraflops	Lowl3v3l: how is that black magic possible?
2016-09-23 17:37:34	MacGyver	grazzolini: There's a PEP mandating that.
2016-09-23 17:37:41	Earnestly	Lowl3v3l: I'll ask though, for things that don't break API/ABI, why are lots of crucial libraries held back when they don't need to be, precluding lots of bug fixes (some of which being security important)?
2016-09-23 17:37:48	poisonby	Python 3 was the stable release upstream, it only makes sense for Arch to use Python3
2016-09-23 17:37:55	Lowl3v3l	grazzolini, and? i don't care wether de docs say it when millions of devs do it differently and you actually care about running the software from those devs ;) 
2016-09-23 17:38:04	grazzolini	Lowl3v3l: lol
2016-09-23 17:38:15	grazzolini	Lowl3v3l: I can't even argue with that
2016-09-23 17:38:18	MacGyver	poisonby: Well, not necessarily, depends on whether you view Python 2 and Python 3 to be the same language.
2016-09-23 17:38:21	Earnestly	Lowl3v3l: you might say, 'backports!', but that doesn't work in reality.  Debian's great security team can't keep up with CVEs and don't fix bugs that don't get a CVE

2016-09-24 11:58:07	zyxon	I am trying to add assign a new mode to my monitor with cvt and xrandr. The mode gets added with xrandr --newmode, but when I try to run xrandr --addmode I get an error message: X Error of failed request:  BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)
2016-09-24 11:58:14	zyxon	anybody knows how I can get around this?

2016-09-24 12:06:15	Earnestly	If only that actually worked
2016-09-24 12:06:25	@grawity	Earnestly: see 'literate programming'
