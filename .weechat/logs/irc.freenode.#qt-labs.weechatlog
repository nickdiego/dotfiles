2016-09-14 14:01:34	+thiago	I used to
2016-09-14 14:01:35	+thiago	let me see...
2016-09-14 14:02:16	+thiago	it's in qmake's source code itself
2016-09-14 14:03:09	+thiago	UnixMakefileGenerator::findLibraries
2016-09-14 14:03:21	svuorela	oh. I think I might have found it. but it might not work. some of it seems to be in the configure.pri
2016-09-14 14:03:37	svuorela	290         qtRunLoggedCommand("$$pg_config --libdir", libdir)|return(false)
2016-09-14 14:03:47	svuorela	292         libdir -= $$QMAKE_DEFAULT_LIBDIRS
2016-09-14 14:03:53	+thiago	so your pkg-config is printing the default lib dir?
2016-09-14 14:04:23	svuorela	no. it isn't using pkg-config, but the old school pg_config
2016-09-14 14:04:50	+thiago	right, pg_config is bad
2016-09-14 14:04:57	+thiago	I thought configure cleaned up that
2016-09-14 14:05:48	+thiago	it doesn't here, even though it prints a lot of junk
2016-09-14 14:05:54	+thiago	$ pg_config --libs

2016-09-14 14:06:14	+thiago	oh, the first two are static libs. Ok, then they aren't junk.
2016-09-14 14:06:52	svuorela	it is calling pg_config --libdir
2016-09-14 14:06:57	+thiago	btw, UnixMakefileGenerator::findLibraries isn't doing the filtering
2016-09-14 14:07:29	svuorela	I think the filtering is the libdir -= $$QMAKE_DEFAULT_LIBDIRS at least for that specific bit.
2016-09-14 14:08:09	+thiago	what variable do you have that in mkspecs/qmodule.pri
2016-09-14 14:08:14	+thiago	I don't have anything for postgresql

2016-09-14 14:09:08	svuorela	the expected if filtering out doesn't work ...
2016-09-14 14:09:54	+thiago	I was searching for pgcommon
2016-09-14 14:09:58	+thiago	QMAKE_LIBS_PSQL = -L/usr/lib/postgresql94/lib64 -lpq

2016-09-14 14:10:49	+thiago	that libdir is pointless, it contains plugins only
2016-09-14 14:15:04	svuorela	maybe I should just switch configure to use pkg-config for psql ?
2016-09-14 14:15:22	svuorela	can I do that in 5.8 without getting things thrown at me ?
2016-09-14 14:15:33	+thiago	yes

2016-09-16 04:20:02	qt_gerrit	fkleint: [qt/qtmultimedia/5.8] Fix compilation after feature modularization in qtbase from Lars Knoll - https://codereview.qt-project.org/171184 (NEW)
2016-09-16 04:20:49	lars	fkleint: haven't really worked on shiboken before. I did look into the code a bit at some point, but I can't claim that I remember much... ;-)
2016-09-16 04:22:14	fkleint	lars: Hm, ok , thingm, the behvavior is such that the order of the functions  it writes out varies from run to run. (causing some trouble)> I wonder why that is, there is some non-determinism
2016-09-16 04:22:45	fkleint	seems the order of fields it gets out of the  code model varies..very odd
2016-09-16 04:22:50	lars	fkleint: they probably use qhash somewhere to store data tables
2016-09-16 04:23:02	lars	fkleint: we had the same issue in qdoc IIRC
2016-09-16 04:23:12	lars	fkleint: initialize the hash seed to 0
2016-09-16 04:23:18	fkleint	probably..means you cannot really diff its output when you fix issues
2016-09-16 04:23:21	fkleint	ah, that might help'
2016-09-16 04:23:43	lars	fkleint: try running with QT_HASH_SEED=0 a couple of times
2016-09-16 04:24:06	lars	if that makes it deterministic, just stick a putenv() into the first line of main() :)

2016-09-16 04:25:03	lars	fkleint: we really shouldn't use hashes for these kind of data structures as they are unordered. maps/trees would probably be better
2016-09-16 04:25:21	fkleint	hm..the thing needs some refactoring anyways
2016-09-16 04:25:32	ulf	erikv: The reordering wasn't a bad problem in the first place. So, go for it.

2016-09-16 09:47:48	annulen	iieklund: where are scripts which control what components are packaged and how?
2016-09-16 09:49:15	iieklund	annulen: configuration files control the payload in installers are in qtsdk.git/packacging-tools/configurations (opensource configurations)
2016-09-16 09:49:29	iieklund	annulen: what content would you add there?
2016-09-16 09:50:56	annulen	iieklund: new qtwebkit, we discussed it with lars. There are no ready binaries and we haven't even finished ci set up, I'm just gathering info
2016-09-16 09:52:39	iieklund	annulen: ok, once the content exists (build artifacts) just let me know, adding new components into sdk is quite trivial, you just need to create 1) pkg template(s) for the installer-framework and 2) configuration file(s) to map payload into given pkg template(s)

2016-09-16 11:14:20	torarne	code review is a collaboration tool, and should encourage and make it easy to rapidly work towards a version of a patch that everyone agrees is GoodTM. the overhead we have today in that process is non-trivial

2016-09-16 12:28:51	+jakepetroules	I really don't care, I just want the build fixed.
2016-09-16 12:31:15	+jakepetroules	apparently all users are on 5,6, so let's keep it for now
2016-09-16 12:32:52	+thiago	no, but I'm not approving either. QtQml may need to have the behaviour change reverted.
2016-09-16 12:33:26	+jakepetroules	then it can be reverted all at once
2016-09-16 12:33:45	+thiago	or not applied at all
2016-09-16 12:34:17	+jakepetroules	build is broken. fixed build + revert is better than broken build.

2016-09-20 03:57:17	mauricek	lars: I see printsupport creates a header defining it

2016-09-20 03:58:39	lars	yep
2016-09-20 03:59:00	mauricek	so I need to enable printsupport to have QT_NO_PRINTER define??
2016-09-20 04:01:06	lars	well, any printer code would need printsupport (so anything guarded by the define)
2016-09-20 04:01:28	annulen|home	lars: I'd like to add wip/next branch of qt/qtwebkit to CI, so that when commit goes in it's built against 5.7 branch (without tronical manually triggering anything)
2016-09-20 04:01:32	lars	but you're right, that one would like to make the QT += printsupport optional depending on it
2016-09-20 04:01:32	mauricek	lars: yes, previously guarded by define and be happy

2016-09-23 00:09:37	+thiago	no
2016-09-23 00:09:51	+thiago	remember that Qt doesn't currently build on my mac?
2016-09-23 00:10:02	+jakepetroules	no idea.
2016-09-23 00:10:15	+thiago	it's a buildsystem problem (not getting the include paths right from the compiler), so I'm not lifting a finger to fix it
2016-09-23 00:10:26	+jakepetroules	I assume you're complaining about some non-standard configuration

2016-09-23 00:13:17	+thiago	I'm not lifting a finger to solve this. I've solved it and the patch wasn't accepted.
2016-09-23 00:13:34	+thiago	Ossi rewrote it. And you've reverted it for dev too.
2016-09-23 00:13:46	+jakepetroules	it broke ioS
