2016-08-04 10:41:45	diegoyam	My lenovo laptop has an Intel GPU with 1 VGA + 1 HDMI outputs. I'm trying to connect 2 external displays/monitors (1 via VGA + 1 via a HDMI/DVI connector), xrandr fails to enable the third screen with the message "Configure crtc 2 failed". I already checked and there are 3 CRTC availables. My first question is: Enable simultaneously 3 displays LVDS, VGA, HDMI/VGA (considering we have 3 CRTCs available) is
2016-08-04 10:41:45	diegoyam	expected to work ?
2016-08-04 10:42:53	tsa	what is the resolution of laptop panel
2016-08-04 10:43:00	diegoyam	It seems similar to this bug https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=68485 , Not sure is a regression of it
2016-08-04 10:43:33	diegoyam	tsa, 1366x768
2016-08-04 10:44:00	tsa	then no MST, check
2016-08-04 10:44:43	tsa	one external works always, no matter which connector?
2016-08-04 10:45:08	diegoyam	tsa: yes
2016-08-04 10:45:35	diegoyam	I'm can enable (manually) the two externals
2016-08-04 10:46:00	diegoyam	but when I try to enable the third one (no matter which one is it) it fails

2016-08-04 11:27:07	Lyude	mattrope: for the actual copying of the new wm/ddb values to dev_priv->wm.skl_hw, would you mind if we did those as we're writing the values to hardware? e.g. in skl_write_cursor_wm() and friends
2016-08-04 11:28:02	danvet	vsyrjala, in case it's not clear: I'll review it since I need it
2016-08-04 11:30:49	mattrope	Lyude: I think that should be okay.  If you're only updating the values for the pipe you're programming, then you shouldn't need wm_mutex to protect the other pipes' values.
2016-08-04 11:31:00	Lyude	mattrope: yep, that's the idea

2016-08-04 11:51:51	vsyrjala	hmm. i should probably try to dig up whatever igts i had cooked up for fb->offsets[] as well

2016-08-18 17:10:54	pacninja	my question is which distro would work out of with box with skylake graphics? tried ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04. had tons of issues(low res., blank screen after boot)
2016-08-18 17:11:35	tjaalton	pacninja: just try updating the kernel
2016-08-18 17:11:56	imirkin_	pacninja: "out of the box" ... hmmm... archlinux if i had to guess. the key is that you need a very up-to-date kernel.
2016-08-18 17:12:05	imirkin_	many distros tend to lag behind in that respect.
2016-08-18 17:12:29	tjaalton	latest driver for SKL on 16.04 has a backported driver from 4.7
2016-08-18 17:12:34	tjaalton	so if that doesn't work, well.. sad
2016-08-18 17:12:39	pacninja	any specific kernel version?
2016-08-18 17:13:06	tjaalton	pacninja: did you manage to install it?
2016-08-18 17:13:14	imirkin_	i've had success with both kernels 4.5.1 and 4.7.0 on a SKL GT2 with 2x 1920x1200 screens daisy-chained over DP (i.e. DP-MST)
2016-08-18 17:13:26	imirkin_	i've had failure with kernel 4.4.x with the above setup
2016-08-18 17:14:27	pacninja	thank you that helps!

2016-08-18 17:14:47	imirkin_	that said, i've heard "bad" things about trying to get a 4k screen to work over DP. but no specifics.
2016-08-18 17:14:55	tjaalton	pacninja: which media did you use for 16.04?
2016-08-18 17:15:47	imirkin_	also note that some other SKL parts, like SKL GT3e, iirc required some additional fixes in kernels that worked fine for SKL GT2. so it might depend on the specific part you have.
2016-08-18 17:15:57	imirkin_	as well as the specific screen you have, and how you're connecting it.
2016-08-18 17:16:04	pacninja	media? vga for display and usb for live cd
2016-08-18 17:16:17	tjaalton	no, which version
2016-08-18 17:16:22	tjaalton	16.04 or 16.04.1
2016-08-18 17:16:36	pacninja	lubuntu 16.04.1
2016-08-18 17:16:39	tjaalton	k
2016-08-18 17:17:15	tjaalton	so did it install? what does 'uname -a' say?
2016-08-18 17:18:43	pacninja	only had successful install with 14.04 just get a blank screen after install of 16.04
2016-08-18 17:18:56	tjaalton	then boot with nomodeset, run all upgrades

2016-08-18 17:20:50	tjaalton	though it sounds like the pciid is "supported"

2016-09-14 15:50:32	curro	jekstrand: i suspect the problem will only be visible with per-sample dispatch (and more than one sample), because otherwise the dispatcher should be able to pack subspans tightly and the DMask will have the form 2^n-1
2016-09-14 15:50:52	curro	i guess if it's testing interpolateAtSample it's very likely to be rendering more than one sample
2016-09-14 15:52:51	jekstrand	curro: yes and no.  For FS, it's really the VMask you care about and that can always be sparse depending on how the threads get executed with respect to rasterization.
2016-09-14 15:53:16	jekstrand	curro: In this case, I had a VMask of 0xff0f or something like that

2016-09-14 15:55:27	curro	jekstrand: yeah, but that's likely because the PSD dispatches samples from a given multisample subspan at a fixed relative location, in cases where it doesn't (e.g. per-pixel dispatch) not packing things tightly is just being inefficient...
2016-09-14 15:58:46	jekstrand	curro: In any case, we can't assume a tight packing.
2016-09-14 15:59:23	Kayden	it does make sense that it'd use a fixed sample->channel mapping for per-sample dispatch, but probably tightly packs for per-pixel
2016-09-14 15:59:39	jekstrand	And ce0 is stupid and doesn't give us what we want.
2016-09-14 15:59:46	Kayden	though I don't imagine we'll ever find docs guaranteeing a tight packing
2016-09-14 16:00:18	jekstrand	I think this is a case of "hardware will do things.  be prepared for the worst."
2016-09-14 16:00:27	jekstrand	Combined, of course, with misleading documentation about what those things are :)
2016-09-14 16:00:55	Kayden	the extra mov/and seems safest
2016-09-14 16:00:59	curro	jekstrand: i'm pretty sure we do in another place, we should probably change it not to do it at least for per-sample shading
2016-09-14 16:02:20	jekstrand	curro: Without documentation stating that things are tightly packed, I don't think I want to restrict it to per-sample shading.

2016-09-14 16:07:52	curro	regarding the behavior of ce0, i've been digging into the simulator...  apparently the logic used to calculate it has changed several times across generations.  I believe on HSW it would return the real execution mask which made it close to completely useless (although this doesn't seem to be properly simulated).  On BDW it would at least take the predication and control-flow mask into account, not sure about the DMask.  Then it lost
2016-09-14 16:07:53	curro	the ability to take the predication mask into account so it only gives you a dumb control-flow mask

2016-09-14 16:12:38	jekstrand	:(
2016-09-14 16:12:47	curro	jekstrand: you could probably avoid the MOV instructions altogether though, and pass either mask register as source to the AND instruction
2016-09-14 16:13:12	jekstrand	curro: Sadly, no.  The ARF is disallowed for src1
2016-09-14 16:13:51	curro	ouch, and it's taking another ARF source already so you cannot swap them?

2016-09-14 16:31:11	curro	jekstrand: if you're going fixing the vec4 path, could you also change brw_find_live_channel to take a 'brw_reg mask' argument instead of a boolean to determine which mask register should used?  seems somewhat more self-documenting and slightly more flexible than true/false
2016-09-14 16:32:07	jekstrand	curro: Sure, I can make that change regardless.  I may add brw_vmask_reg and brw_dmask_reg helpers while I'm at it.

2016-09-14 18:04:07	curro	jekstrand: seems reasonable, you could potentially change the 'devinfo->gen >= 8' condition in the align16 path too, so either the ce0 or gen7 path gets used based on whether a ~0 mask was given as argument (i'm not quite sure yet whether the packing assumption is valid for the GS, but it seems likely).  or do you think it's not worth the effort looking into and we should just always assume sparse dispatch?
2016-09-14 18:05:20	jekstrand	Given that it's a single extra instruction in vec4, I don't think it's worth messing around with ec0 in align16
2016-09-14 18:05:30	jekstrand	We can bring it back if we really think it's worth it

2016-09-14 18:17:20	dviola	if I remove that and use modesetting or if xf86-video-intel is using DRI3, that problem is gone

2016-09-14 18:18:04	jekstrand	ah
2016-09-14 18:18:08	jekstrand	No idea what's going wrong.

2016-09-14 18:35:21	jekstrand	curro: Are you sure that comment about quarter control for ce0 is accurate?
2016-09-14 18:35:35	jekstrand	We only ever touch it with a 1-wide exec_all instruction
2016-09-14 18:37:16	dviola	does everything defaults to dri3 these days?
2016-09-14 18:37:28	dviola	upstream/in most distros
2016-09-14 18:39:51	curro	jekstrand: i'm pretty sure i tested the quarter control behavior of ce0 on real hardware (where real hardware of the time was likely Gen8), but it's perfectly possible that they broke it at some later point together with predication
2016-09-14 18:40:26	jekstrand	curro: In any case, I don't think the comment really applies anymore since we're doing a 1-wide instruction
2016-09-14 18:40:43	jekstrand	Unless you can still do quarter-control with a 1-wide instruction...
2016-09-14 18:40:53	curro	jekstrand: the execution size of the instruction doesn't have any influence on it
2016-09-14 18:41:25	jekstrand	Ok, that makes sense
2016-09-14 18:41:39	tarceri	I'm seeing a nir_deref with a glsl_type int[2][2][2][2][2][2][2][2] but deref_type != nir_deref_type_array how can that happen?
2016-09-14 18:41:57	jekstrand	tarceri: Is it in a copy_var?
2016-09-14 18:42:26	tarceri	it might be
2016-09-14 18:42:32	jekstrand	If it is, then it's ok
2016-09-14 18:42:41	jekstrand	copy_var is the only NIR instruction where incomplete derefs are allowed

2016-09-14 18:48:12	jekstrand	tarceri: First off, derefs in NIR go from var to tail not tail to var
2016-09-14 18:48:47	jekstrand	tarceri: The firt thing in the list is always a deref_var so your first "if" there will always fail.
2016-09-14 18:49:13	jekstrand	tarceri: The easier thing to do is probably to just walk the list of derefs looking for indirects and checking to see if any of them are your induction variable.
2016-09-14 18:49:17	jekstrand	If one is, unroll.
2016-09-14 18:49:28	jekstrand	There's no reason why it has to be the tail of the loop.
2016-09-14 18:49:36	jekstrand	Any time we cana get rid of indirects, it's a good thing.
2016-09-14 18:49:45	jekstrand	s/tail of the loop/tail of the deref/
2016-09-14 18:51:04	curro	jekstrand: AFAICT the PSD collects incoming subspans into a FIFO that filters out subspans with no lit samples on them (on all generations i've checked so far).  in per-pixel dispatch mode that probably implies that only fully lit subspans will be packed into the SIMD thread, so the packing assumption is likely to be (conditionally) valid even on the PS

2016-09-14 18:52:08	tarceri	jekstrand: yeah I have a todo for that I was just trying to get it working for single dimensions first, and your right I'm missing a tail = tail->child thanks
2016-09-14 18:52:55	jekstrand	tarceri: When working with derefs, I find that it's usually easier to just walk the thing than to think about exactly which part of the deref you want.
2016-09-14 18:53:25	jekstrand	In other words, it's proably harder to get the "simple case" right than to just implement it in full.
2016-09-14 18:54:04	tarceri	ok thanks for the tip
2016-09-14 18:54:21	jekstrand	np
2016-09-14 18:58:07	jekstrand	curro: What I observed from my little walk through the simulator is that, in per-pixel, it seems to execute the same subspan in the SIMD execution just different samples.  So, for SIMD16 and 16x for instance, it would execute 4 times for each subspan, each time taking 4 samples.
2016-09-14 18:59:20	jekstrand	curro: I wouldn't be surprised if the mapping from sample ids to nibs is fixed so if you have a single sample id where some 2x2 isn't lit at all, you end up with a hole in your vmask.
2016-09-14 18:59:51	curro	jekstrand: this is assuming per-pixel dispatch
2016-09-14 19:00:07	jekstrand	right
2016-09-14 19:00:23	jekstrand	I was providing my per-sample observations in hopes of clerifying the model
2016-09-14 19:00:37	jekstrand	In any case, I wouldn't be at all surprised if it is dense for per-pixel
2016-09-14 19:00:52	jekstrand	You can still have disabled channels, they just come at the end
2016-09-14 19:01:55	curro	i'm pretty sure there can be gaps in per-sample mode, because different samples from the same subspan have a fixed relative location in the SIMD thread, only whole unlit subspans are discarded by the PSD dispatch logic
2016-09-14 19:02:09	jekstrand	right
2016-09-14 19:02:12	airlied	jekstrand: so one issue I see if SpvDimSubpass, I've no idea what we shoould map it to
2016-09-14 19:02:14	jekstrand	makes sense
2016-09-14 19:02:17	airlied	I mapped it to _EXTERNAL
2016-09-14 19:02:20	airlied	but that falls over later
2016-09-14 19:02:28	jekstrand	airlied: 2D
2016-09-14 19:02:38	jekstrand	airlied: Just a simple-as-they-come 2-D texture
2016-09-14 19:02:48	-->	sphalerite (~linus@srv.soundray.org) has joined #intel-gfx
2016-09-14 19:02:48	airlied	it seems like it would match more with EXTERNAL though :)
2016-09-14 19:03:00	airlied	since that is a single-layer 2D thing
2016-09-14 19:03:05	jekstrand	Why, it's not external to anything
2016-09-14 19:03:36	airlied	well there are limitation on SpvDimSubpass that don't apply to 2D
2016-09-14 19:03:50	jekstrand	The annoying part is that the SPIR-V committee, in all of their infite wisdom, decided that input attachments act more like storage images than textures.
2016-09-14 19:03:53	jekstrand	grr.....
2016-09-14 19:04:00	jekstrand	Sure
2016-09-14 19:04:15	airlied	but yeah 2D probably makes sense
2016-09-14 19:04:31	jekstrand	You could add a SAMPLER_DIM if you really wanted to
2016-09-14 19:05:00	chrisf	jekstrand: is 2d always right?
2016-09-14 19:05:10	 *	airlied will get vkQuake going first and then figure out the subtle bit
2016-09-14 19:05:10	jekstrand	chrisf: For input attachments?  Yes.
2016-09-14 19:05:52	jekstrand	chrisf: I mean, it could be a 1-D, but our hardware doesn't care.
2016-09-14 19:06:13	jekstrand	It's pretty forgiving about mismatching sampler and image dimensions
2016-09-14 19:06:30	chrisf	it's not necessarily single-layer though
2016-09-14 19:06:37	jekstrand	right...
2016-09-14 19:06:41	jekstrand	that might get interesting
2016-09-14 19:07:15	jekstrand	Ugh...
2016-09-14 19:08:03	jekstrand	Yeah, so, it turns out nobody though about that...
2016-09-14 19:09:12	chrisf	actually making good use of that flexibility is unpleasant though with the layer count in the framebuffer rather than the subpass
2016-09-14 19:09:54	jekstrand	chrisf: That's going to be a problem.  We don't know the VkImageType at pipeline create time so we may have to get creative...
2016-09-14 19:10:37	jekstrand	With 1-D arrays, we need to give it (x, gl_LayerId) not (x, y, gl_LayerId)
2016-09-14 19:16:31	jekstrand	chrisf: Yeah, I'm not seeing good options for handling 1-D arrays other than passing in a uniform and switching on it. :(
2016-09-14 19:17:14	chrisf	that's fairly horrid for a <1% case
2016-09-14 19:17:25	jekstrand	no kidding
2016-09-14 19:17:44	jekstrand	Maybe I should just bribe someone to *not* write that CTS test :)
2016-09-14 19:18:37	chrisf	i'm all about mean tests though :)
2016-09-14 19:18:46	jekstrand	Actually.....
2016-09-14 19:19:44	jekstrand	If I somehow know that my FB is only 1 pixel high, I can do (x, gl_LayerId, gl_LayerId) and use CLAMP_TO_EDGE
2016-09-14 19:20:07	jekstrand	Never mind, clamping doesn't apply to texelFetch
2016-09-14 19:20:35	chrisf	can you just declare this thing nonrenderable (or unusable as an input attachment at least) ?
2016-09-14 19:21:46	imirkin	jekstrand: are you sure? that's not my recollection
2016-09-14 19:21:57	imirkin	but i've always been weak on these distinctions
2016-09-14 19:22:05	jekstrand	Still, I could do (x, 1darr ? gl_LayerId : y, gl_LayerId) which is only one extra sel
2016-09-14 19:22:18	jekstrand	chrisf: Sadly, no.
2016-09-14 19:23:17	jekstrand	airlied: In any case, we need a magic dim so that I can do silly work-arounds in my driver.
2016-09-14 19:23:37	jekstrand	airlied: Not sure about AMD HW but we need to be able to distinguish between 1D_ARRAY and everything else.
2016-09-14 19:24:09	jekstrand	Prior to Sky Lake, I may be able to just pretend it's a 2-D texture
2016-09-14 19:29:16	chrisf	jekstrand: im not seeing anything clear on exactly what combinations you must not reject from GetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties
2016-09-14 19:35:55	jekstrand	chrisf: We must accept color attachments for all types for a pile of stuff
2016-09-14 19:36:04	jekstrand	And there's no way to reject input attachments
2016-09-14 19:37:08	chrisf	jekstrand: you have to advertise IMAGE_FEATURE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT in the format features, but you can reject IMAGE_USAGE_INPUT_ATTACHMENT_BIT there
2016-09-14 19:37:31	jekstrand	I guess we could...

2016-09-14 21:28:20	jekstrand	tarceri: I'm not sure.
2016-09-14 21:28:26	jekstrand	tarceri: Honestly, I don't think it's needed.
2016-09-14 21:28:47	jekstrand	tarceri: NIR is built as a toolbox where it's your job as the driver developer to call the passes you want.
2016-09-14 21:29:03	jekstrand	tarceri: In contrast, GLSL IR has a central loop with lots of bits to control it.
2016-09-14 21:29:10	jekstrand	This looks a lot like "bits to control it"
2016-09-14 21:29:49	jekstrand	tarceri: In the Vulkan driver, we just use the GLSL bits from brw_compiler and we don't have a separate NIR structure
2016-09-14 21:31:52	tarceri	jekstrand: The problem I was having is I need to run the loop anaylsis pass to know if I should force unrolling and I need the "bit to control it" inside that pass
2016-09-14 21:33:14	tarceri	I guess I could just force unrolling for all indirects
2016-09-14 21:33:39	jekstrand	tarceri: There's a bunch of passes that have options structs
2016-09-14 21:34:08	jekstrand	tarceri: We just don't, in general, have one big struct
2016-09-14 21:34:20	jekstrand	We do, but maybe it should become nir_opt_algebraic_options

2016-09-14 21:35:29	jekstrand	tarceri: For loop unrolling, I'd just pass in a nir_var_mode of "unroll if these are indirect"
2016-09-14 21:35:35	tarceri	The problem is loop anaylsis was setup as a metadata pass so it makes it a bit more tricky
2016-09-14 21:35:35	jekstrand	nir_var_mode is a bitfield after all

2016-09-15 04:56:45	PaulePanter	Though I expected that. I would have thought, Linux Dell users (Ubuntu is shipped with some) report problem to Dell, and then Dell to Ubuntu or Intel directly.

2016-09-15 05:01:59	j4ni	there are very few OEMs shipping linux, and even for them it seems to be a niche. the ones shipping linux probably deal with the OSV (predominantly canonical/ubuntu it looks like), and the others don't have any incentive
2016-09-15 05:05:15	PaulePanter	j4ni: Understood. Very sad. Hopefully that changes.

2016-09-15 05:10:10	j4ni	I'm of course just speculating, but even the ones shipping linux probably only support the preinstalled distro as-is, not something else. which is probably quite uninteresting to a lot of people around here, for example
2016-09-15 05:10:55	vsyrjala	tsa: fyi fi-snb-2600 is a gt1 actually. the hw page claims it's a gt2
2016-09-15 05:12:10	PaulePanter	Well, if I’d get the Max Planck institutes to add GNU/Linux support to their advertized bidding, that’d be quite some systems. But probably not enough for big companies like Dell or Fujitsu to care.

2016-09-15 07:09:10	j4ni	PaulePanter: stuff like that is pretty clearly on our turf. it gets fuzzy when the issue is in the OEM doing weird stuff with the hardware.
2016-09-15 07:10:01	j4ni	like adding some extra chips for backlight, or embedding protocol converters for the display outputs they have on the chassis, or something
2016-09-15 07:10:50	PaulePanter	j4ni: Understood.
2016-09-15 07:11:24	j4ni	or using flat panels that violate the spec, and so on
2016-09-15 07:11:41	PaulePanter	Although you have quite a few working on Linux already, it’d be great if your position would be strengthened because the vendors offer GNU/Linux support.
2016-09-15 07:12:08	PaulePanter	Actually I have no idea, if that’s even possible in the Microsoft Windows world, or if it just gets more testing before the delivery.

2016-09-15 07:15:59	j4ni	coincidentally, therein lies a danger with OEMs shipping linux. they're used to tweaking the BIOS to workaround issues, and they'll continue to do the same for their machines shipping linux.

2016-09-15 09:33:52	vsyrjala	i also wonder how eg. composite window pixmap mangling cooperates with present window pixmap mangling...
2016-09-15 09:34:40	ickle	hmm, the change in ordering means that damage is now being generated on the screen as opposed to an invisible pixmap
2016-09-15 09:34:52	ickle	so the issue is that swapping the pixmaps isn't sending damage
2016-09-15 09:36:31	vsyrjala	i was thinking the copy itself would be clobbering something else, but since ->root should be using the same pixmap that doesn't sound entirely sensible

2016-09-15 09:39:03	vsyrjala	right. yeah there's damage, but no need to re-expose anything because of this pixmap swapping
2016-09-15 09:39:23	vsyrjala	no compositor running here

2016-09-15 09:41:35	vsyrjala	so feels like this copy is overwriting the redraw from the exposures generated by the window(s) changing size
2016-09-15 09:43:36	ickle	the unflip is meant to as soon as the window is resized, before the events iirc
2016-09-15 09:44:09	ickle	but if nothing is listening to damage, expose fits
2016-09-15 09:47:02	ickle	present_copy_region will honour the clip on the window
2016-09-15 09:47:20	ickle	I wonder if that is updated before the unflip
2016-09-15 09:49:07	vsyrjala	the unflip could happen due to the clip no longer being suitable right? so my answer is yes
2016-09-15 09:51:01	vsyrjala	but still, even if other windows get exposed before the copy, all windows should have their pixmaps pointing at flip_pixmap until unflip. thus the redraw should end up in flip_pixmap, and the copy should then copy the freshly redrawn content back to the screen pixmap
2016-09-15 09:52:17	vsyrjala	so feels like my patch is just hiding the problem by not copying the whole pixmap

2016-09-15 18:25:07	imirkin	doc|work: each codec has different profiles (or levels), and each one of those has various maxes. figure out what level the hw in question supports and you'll have your answer
2016-09-15 18:25:16	imirkin	well, mpeg2 is a lot easier to decode than hevc
2016-09-15 18:25:18	doc|work	This is my first project doing anything video related, and man, it all seems such a mess of things
2016-09-15 18:25:28	imirkin	so you can decode higher bitrate mpeg2 than you can hevc
2016-09-15 18:25:40	doc|work	ok, so, long story short, trial and error :D
2016-09-15 18:26:04	imirkin	no...
2016-09-15 18:28:34	imirkin	i mean, the empirical way would obviously work
2016-09-15 18:28:37	jekstrand	If you're looking for theoretical maximums, no.  If you're looking for "I want to stream video to this thing and have it play back smoothly", maybe.
2016-09-15 18:28:41	imirkin	but first things first - "target bitrate" - target bitrate for what?

2016-09-15 19:22:14	jkqxz	Levels mean little for anything other than conformance, and not much even then.  VAAPI uses the profile and then actual frame size constraints, and makes no declaration about how fast it can decode those.
2016-09-15 19:22:27	jkqxz	In practice on Intel hardware the bitrate is mostly irrelevant, because the bottleneck is in other places.  A 50Mbps decode (or encode) is only a little bit slower than a 5Mbps one, and that is mainly because of the need to shuffle more data around in memory.

2016-09-16 18:58:26	Mercury	Alright, I've got one.  Intel 3337U, on an HP laptop (EliteBook 9470m), X works fine, but monitor detection on the console is decidedly iffy.
2016-09-16 18:59:02	Mercury	Specifically, with the lid closed and monitors attached to the dock, it renders nothing to a visible display at all until I unplug/turn off one of the monitors, at which point it starts to render to the remaining one.
2016-09-16 19:00:00	Mercury	My best guess is that the disconnect from displayport is triggering the logic to reprobe displays in general.  But a switch to X and then back to the console looses the display again until I do the same dance.

2016-09-23 16:04:08	dhnkrn	It was reverted because it was causing a kernel crash.

2016-09-23 19:19:57	jljusten	hmm... I guess I'm offsetting the dst surface, so, maybe I messed up offsetting an aux buf?
2016-09-23 19:22:18	Kayden	it might make sense just to resolve buffers if we have to split up a blit, so we don't have to think about offsetting aux stuff
2016-09-23 19:22:27	Kayden	though I hear we know how to do that these days
2016-09-23 19:22:43	Kayden	it sounds pretty miserable to me :)
2016-09-23 19:24:00	jljusten	is fast color clear on hsw a single color in the surface state? or, encoded in an aux buf?
2016-09-23 19:26:34	Kayden	single color in the surface state
2016-09-23 19:26:56	Kayden	I believe the aux buf uses 0xffffffffffffffffff to indicate "this is clear"
